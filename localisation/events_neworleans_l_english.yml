neworleans.1.t:0 "The Trial of the Democrats"
neworleans.1.d:0 "With the black population of New Orleans finally being represented it is high time we conduct trials of the old racist and corrupt Democrat politicians. They will be sentenced by a diverse jury to represent out cities demographics, and to keep the trial fair. Though it is unlikely they will beat the charges of racketeering and corruption. Most of the men charged will be sent to municipal prisons."
neworleans.1.a:0 "Good Riddance!"
