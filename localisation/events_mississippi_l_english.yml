 mississippi.1.d:0 "After must anticipation Theodore G Bilbo has returned to take his third non-consecutive term as Governor.  Bilbo is the only man to be elected to three terms as Governor of Mississippi. He was previously elected in 1915 and 1927 respectively. He comes to Jackson fresh off his win in the 1935 Democratic Primary and General election, the former of which he whipped Hugh White in a runoff. Bilbo promises to do his best for the rednecks of the state and to lick the grafters in Jackson. Bilbo and his predecessor, Martin S Conner, elected in 1931 as Governor, joked about food served by the Jackson dinery."
 mississippi.1.a:0 "Bilbo!"
 
 mississippi.2.t:0 "State of Mississippi"
 mississippi.2.d:0 "Mississippi state of affairs since it left the Union in the summer of 1932 have been rough but progressive. Governor Conner has served the state since 1932 as chief executive under his reforms the budget has managed well. He also has endorsed many social programs to help those in need. Many conservatives criticize his relationship with Louisiana’s said Dictator Huey Long. Since the fall of Union Conner and Long have been a close as brothers thus bringing the respective countries closer than ever. In 1934 when Long bolted to Democratic Party and joined the Jeffersonian Democrats, Conner followed. Thus, many hardline Democrats have accused Conner of treason to the party. Despite this Conner has held strong to his strong friendship with Long claiming that 20 roads have been built to connect our two great lands. Conner was unable to run in the 1935 election and instead backed a young World War veteran and lawyer Ross Barnett as the Jeffersonian Democrat. Barnett however was easily defeated by Democratic Nominee Bilbo in November."

 mississippi.3.t:0 "The Man"
 mississippi.3.d:0 "Bilbo career in Mississippi is legendary. The three-time elected Governor and former Lt Governor has been a constant figure of rednecks and farmers in rural Mississippi. Bilbo is a protégé of Senator James Vardaman one of fiery populists of old who lead the original redneck revolt against the wealthy planter class of the Delta. Like his political father he had been the center of controversy on numerous occasions the latest being his de-accreditation of Mississippi colleges due to purging teachers who he thought were teaching race mixing. This issue was quickly overshadowed as he made a comeback cursing Hebert Hoover on the eve of secession. Bilbo was one of  the leading secessionists and led the debate at the secession convention which saw Mississippi leave the Union. Many however fear Bilbo recklessness may further the economic depression as he scares off northern investors with his anti-negro rhetoric. After all he’s a Klansman."
