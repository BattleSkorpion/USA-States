 mississippi.1.t:0 "Inaugeration Day"
 mississippi.1.d:0 "After must anticipation Theodore G Bilbo has returned to take his third non-consecutive term as Governor.  Bilbo is the only man to be elected to three terms as Governor of Mississippi. He was previously elected in 1915 and 1927 respectively. He comes to Jackson fresh off his win in the 1935 Democratic Primary and General election, the former of which he whipped Hugh White in a runoff. Bilbo promises to do his best for the rednecks of the state and to lick the grafters in Jackson. Bilbo and his predecessor, Martin S Conner, elected in 1931 as Governor, joked about food served by the Jackson dinery."
