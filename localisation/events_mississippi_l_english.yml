 mississippi.1.d:0 "After must anticipation Theodore G Bilbo has returned to take his third non-consecutive term as Governor.  Bilbo is the only man to be elected to three terms as Governor of Mississippi. He was previously elected in 1915 and 1927 respectively. He comes to Jackson fresh off his win in the 1935 Democratic Primary and General election, the former of which he whipped Hugh White in a runoff. Bilbo promises to do his best for the rednecks of the state and to lick the grafters in Jackson. Bilbo and his predecessor, Martin S Conner, elected in 1931 as Governor, joked about food served by the Jackson dinery."
 mississippi.1.a:0 "Bilbo!"
 
 mississippi.2.t:0 "State of Mississippi"
 mississippi.2.d:0 "Mississippi state of affairs since it left the Union in the summer of 1932 have been rough but progressive. Governor Conner has served the state since 1932 as chief executive under his reforms the budget has managed well. He also has endorsed many social programs to help those in need. Many conservatives criticize his relationship with Louisianas said Dictator Huey Long. Since the fall of Union Conner and Long have been a close as brothers thus bringing the respective countries closer than ever. In 1934 when Long bolted to Democratic Party and joined the Jeffersonian Democrats, Conner followed. Thus, many hardline Democrats have accused Conner of treason to the party. Despite this Conner has held strong to his strong friendship with Long claiming that 20 roads have been built to connect our two great lands. Conner was unable to run in the 1935 election and instead backed a young World War veteran and lawyer Ross Barnett as the Jeffersonian Democrat. Barnett however was easily defeated by Democratic Nominee Bilbo in November."
 mississippi.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 
 mississippi.3.t:0 "The Man"
 mississippi.3.d:0 "Bilbo career in Mississippi is legendary. The three-time elected Governor and former Lt Governor has been a constant figure of rednecks and farmers in rural Mississippi. Bilbo is a protégé of Senator James Vardaman one of fiery populists of old who lead the original redneck revolt against the wealthy planter class of the Delta. Like his political father he had been the center of controversy on numerous occasions the latest being his de-accreditation of Mississippi colleges due to purging teachers who he thought were teaching race mixing. This issue was quickly overshadowed as he made a comeback cursing Hebert Hoover on the eve of secession. Bilbo was one of  the leading secessionists and led the debate at the secession convention which saw Mississippi leave the Union. Many however fear Bilbo recklessness may further the economic depression as he scares off northern investors with his anti-negro rhetoric. After all he’s a Klansman."
 mississippi.3.a:0 "This will be Fun."
 
 
mississippi.4.t:0 "Negro Revolt"
mississippi.4.d:0 "Angry over the recent execution of the Scotosbro Boys negroes have siezed power in the Deleta. The forces have been organized by the Southern Tenant Farmers Unions. We suspect labor organizer Rex Douglas is behind this. He has been seen in Greenville waving their new flag. Even worse is that they have seized several armories and apear to fully armed albiet not with the best equipment. We will have to act soon or else risk them growing too powerful."
mississippi.4.a:0 "Damn Communists!"

mississippi.5.t:0   "Pick Sucessor"
mississippi.5.d:0 "In the upcoming election it seems the Jeffersonian Democrat Party will have a firm edge. However, we need to select who from our own Primary we will endorse. On one hand we have the loyal Barnett, a man who ran for our party in 1935 and loss. On the other hand we have former US Representive and more recently our House Floor leader John E Rankin. While a tough worker for our values Rankin is a old isolationist who rather let MS stay quiet they expand. Barnett on the otherhand is agressive but has less experienced leading. He also has a streak of economic conservatism. Both have talents but only one shall rule."
mississippi.5.a:0 "Old Rankin"
mississippi.5.b:0  "Ross Barnett"
