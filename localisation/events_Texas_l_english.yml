    texas.1.d:0 "With political chaos engulfing the nation, many prominent figures under the Ku Klux Klan in Texas have gathered and have released a manifesto. Their goal is to unite all of the former Southern United States under the Klan, and they plan to drive all of those who oppose them either to extinction or simply out of their country. Some have started gathering support in many of the major cities."
