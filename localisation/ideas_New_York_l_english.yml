    SNY_failing_democracy_desc:0 "We have been unable to hold our country together. Be it through political deadlock or an extremist leader coming to power, our democracy is failing but the general populous still cry for Democracy to return. It will not be an easy fight to take it away from them."

    SNY_political_deadlock:0 "Political Deadlock"
    SNY_political_deadlock_desc:0 "Ever since the impeachment of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the country has been in an unstable state. Congress is divided between Progressives and Democrats, those who are still loyal to FDR and those who are loyal to the state."
    SNY_political_violence:0 "Political Violence"
    SNY_political_violence_desc:0 "The political deadlock faced before has begun to turn violent. Progressives and Democrats continue to butt heads and other members have turned to fringe and, often, more radical ideologies. While there is still a strong core of pro-Democracy members in Congress, more and more members are advocating for much more radical solutions to our crises. Some of these members will stop at nothing to advance their political goals, even going so far as hiring private police to do dirty work."

    SNY_legacy_of_FDRs_impeachment:0 "Legacy of FDR's Impeachment"
    SNY_legacy_of_FDRs_impeachment_desc:0 "New York was one of the last states to secede from the Union. This reluctance was mostly thanks to Franklin D. Roosevelt. As the United States of America continued to fracture and plunge deeper into chaos, New York remained a strong ally to the Government in D.C.. That is, until Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York City, found it best for the city if it was independent from the Union. Fiorello made many formal requests to FDR for the whole state of New York to finally secede from the Union, but FDR refused. Nearing the end of 1932, Fiorello threatened to secede from not only the Union but also the state of New York if things did not change. With the threat of loosing the largest and most important city of New York, the New York State Assembly and Senate pushed to remove FDR from office. In the process of impeachment, many local militias of New York State - funded by New York City - revolted against the United State's Government. This revolt would result in New York becoming the second to last state to secede from the union in December 1932. Now an independent republic, New York State officialized the impeachment of FDR and FDR subsequently fled to the District of Columbia. The New York State Assembly and Senate formed the Congress of this new nation. The next Congress would come to be more loyal to the ideals of FDR, but nothing could be done because he was impeached. Around half of Congress and many of the people of New York remember FDR fondly, the strong memory of FDR will persist in New York until another leader can come to power to satisfy the needs of the people."

    SNY_independent_new_york_city:0 "Independent New York City"
    SNY_independent_new_york_city_desc:0 "The impeachment of Franklin D. Roosevelt was driven in large part because of the threat that New York City would secede from New York State if the State would not secede from the failing Union. Despite the impeachment eventually passing, the damage was already done. New York City no longer trusted that its best interests were being looked out for by the State. In a compromise, New York City became a highly autonomous region of New York State, with its own politics and many of the powers of an independent country."
