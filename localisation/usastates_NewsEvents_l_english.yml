 usastates_news.6.d:0 "Following several months of growing tension, the Oregon Civil War has broken out. Six factions are fighting for control over the one peaceful state. In the east, fighting is taking place in the Unitary Republic of Oregon and several break off factions. In the west of Oregon, the Socialist Republic of Oregon and the old government of the Republic lie, locked in a bloody battle for control over the vital Willamette Valley. Despite just beginning, it is clear that the Oregon Civil War is going to be a near verbatim copy of the Western Front of the Great War. Trenches are already lining the vast majority of the former state. Whichever faction emerges victorious from the bloody conflict, it is clear to all: Oregon will never again be the same."
