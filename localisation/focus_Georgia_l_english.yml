SGA_policetheklan_desc:0 "Blacks were enfranchised in the old Union after the end of the Civil War, but ever since then the Klan and others disgruntled by this new reality would prevent them from carrying out that right.

SGA_encouragingprivatemanufactories_desc:0 "Having an arsenal is well and good, but we also have hardly any private manufacturers for arms.
