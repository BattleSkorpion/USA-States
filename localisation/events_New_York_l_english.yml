    new_york.1.t:0 "The Army Questions the Ability of the Administration"
    new_york.1.d:0 "The Army has called into question the ability of Herbert Lehman and the administration as a whole to run New York State. They say that if things do not change soon, the country will reach a breaking point and they do not want to be the ones dealing with such a mistake. The Army has told Lehman to either fix the country or they will fix it themselves."

    new_york.2.t:0 "The Navy Questions the Ability of the Administration"
    new_york.2.d:0 "Following the example of the army, the Navy has formally questioned the ability of the Administration. Echoing many of the same points of the army, The Navy has stated that if things do not get better soon, they will shift their allegiance to other countries as they see fit. The Navy has told Lehman to either fix the country or they will abandon us."
    new_york.2.a:0 "Not the Navy!"
    
    new_york.3.t:0 "The Military Abandons the Capital"
    new_york.3.d:0 "With the situation in the country still not improving, the army has shown that they were not joking around when they said that the country must be fixed. Every guard, soldier, and other armed personnel have been moved away from the capital in protest. The leading generals have told us that if the country becomes stable once again, they will return to guarding the capital building, but for now they stated they are done attacking peaceful protesters."
    new_york.3.a:0 "What's the Worst that Could Happen?"

    new_york.4.t:0 "Herbert H. Lehman Criticizes the Army"
    new_york.4.d:0 "Herbert H. Lehman, the president of New York State, made a speech this morning criticizing the actions of The Army. \"While The Army may have criticized me and my administration, I have never performed an action so foolish as to abandon the capital building in a time of great need and instability for the great country of New York we call home. It is clear to me that their action was uninformed and I hope they see the error in their action and decide to return to defending the capital building in Albany.\" Lehman's speech did little to change the mind or hearts of The Army and the people who support their actions."
    new_york.4.a:0 "There's Nothing we can do to stop Them"
    new_york.4.b:0 "The Country Shouldn't need us There Anyway!"

    new_york.5.t:0 "The Albany Attack"
    new_york.5.d:0 "Early this morning, the usual protest gathered in front of the capital building in Albany. Without the army there to threaten the protesters, the size of the protest was the largest since the breakup of the Union. On the streets, the protesters called for true democracy in the republic, for Franklin D. Roosevelt to return, for the end of the slaughter of innocent protesters by the hands of the police and - until recently - the army, and or change. \"We demand Life! We demand Liberty! We demand the Right to Pursue Happiness!\" Their cries could be heard for blocks and blocks surrounding the capital building in Albany. Herbert H. Lehman attempted to address the crowd like he always does. \"I have been trying my hardest to bring Life, Liberty, and Happiness to the people of New York. But it is Congress, not I, that continually wishes to stifle our Democracy and keep our country in a situation of prolonged political deadlock!\" Lehman's speech was cut short by the sound of gunfire radiating from the crowd. Immediately, Lehman retreated into the capital building for safety and a poorly known, radical left congressman walked out from the crowd and gave his speech, his firearm concealed by his suit. \"Brothers in arms, we have gathered here today not because we are satisfied and to tell Lehman he's done a good job, we have gathered here today because was are DISSATISFIED and because Lehman has NOT done a good job.\" He paused for a brief applause from the crowd. \"Today is the day we must show Lehman just how unsatisfied we are with his administration!\" More applause. \"Now follow me fellow citizens of New York, follow me in my, in our, attack on the very administration that has made our lives hell! WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES NOON, WE ATTACK!\" More applause erupted from the crowd, many of them now blinded by the words of the congressman many of them didn't even know was a congressman. When the hour was noon, what would become known as \"The Albany Attack\" commenced. While initially lead by the congressman from before, he eventually retreated because he knew violence would ensue. In the end over two dozen protesters and guards were killed in the attack before the rest of the crowd was discouraged and gave up. While the number of people killed may have not been as much as in other tragic event in the past, it was enough to demonstrate the political instability in New York, the political violence. This attack will surely change the course of the country forever and will be remembered for many generations to come."
