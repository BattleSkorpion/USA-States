    OS.0.t:0 "Communists Seize Springfield"
    OS.0.d:0  "Just as many in the upper echelons of the National Guard feared, the Oregon Red Army has finally made a move, and under the shadow of darkness, seized the city of Springfield. This gives them a base from which to strike Salem with. The Red Army is still on the move however, and Governor Meier is expected to respond any minute now..."
    OS.0.a:0 "Those Damn Reds!"

    OS.1.t:0 "Governor Meier Declares Martial Law"
    OS.1.d:0 "With Communist forces only a scant few hours from Salem,Governor Meier has decided too, with little legal basis, declared that the entirety of Oregon, from Astoria to Rome, is now under martial law. He is hoping above all, that with no legislative oversight, he will be able to crush the rebels once and for all!"
    OS.1.a:0 "Let us hope he is right"
