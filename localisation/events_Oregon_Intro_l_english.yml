    ORIN.2.t:0 "History of the Republic of Oregon"
    ORIN.2.d:0 "When California left the Union in February of 1932, the Giant of the Pacific took Oregon and Washington with her. Oregon was happy enough to go along with this plan, after all, Oregon and Cali's economies had become more intertwined ever since the Great Depression. While Washington could, economically anyway, stand on her own two feet, Oregon was far from economically stable. The only reason the economy didn't implode right at her independence was due to massive amounts of cash flowing in from Sacramento. This situation placed Oregon in the situation of being a puppet of California in all but name. Even the flag of the Republic of Oregon, adopted on July 4th, 1932, reflects the so-called \"special relationship\" Oregon has with California.\n The first major threat to the existence of the newly established Republic was not in fact an economic implosion. It was a Revolution. To be exact, a communist revolution, led by the reorganized Communist Party of Oregon, headed by newly elected chairman John 'Jack' Reed. Reed since 1917 had been in the Soviet Union, first simply as a journalist, but as the Union began to fall apart, he was trained by the Red Army on the arts of Gruella Warfare. Just as Lenin was sent into Russia by Germany to lead a revolution, so was Reed returned to Oregon, under an assumed name of course. Reed was to lead the workers of Oregon in a glorious Revolution to overthrow the corrupt Republican government and create a bastion of socialism on the west coast. From Oregon, Reed would led the Red Army to bring the Revolution to the entirety to America, and be hailed as the American Lenin.\n As soon as Reed got off the boat, he was able to link up with his Comrades in the CPO(most notable his wife, Louise Bryant, who had been leading the CPO in his stead) and tell them of the glorious Revolutionary Plan, which as loyal party members they begin to prepare for immediately. In total, it took about six months to be able to gather enough men and guns for the uprising. The vast bulk of the Oregon Red Army was made up of either rank and file members of the CPO, lumbermen who had been members of the IWW, or simple mercenaries, as the Soviet Union had been sending the CPO massive amounts of counterfeit currency to help prepare for the uprising. It was on August 15th 1932 that the Oregon Red Army rose up all around the former state, although the bulk of the Red Army was in the Willamette Valley, near Salem.\n To call the initial uprising a failure would be to do a massive disservice to the ORA. For nearly two weeks, the ORA was able to stand its ground, even holding Portland for a two-day period until the National Guard took the city back. After those first two weeks however, the ORA was no threat at all to the forces of the National Guard. After the Battle of Springfield, the western half of ORA was forced underground, with most retreating either towards the Coast or the Cascades.  Although the ORA was crushed in the Willamette Valley by the Oregon National Guard, Eastern Oregon was a different story. As the National Guard was tied up protecting the Capital, the Red Army was able to take vast swaths of the Eastern half of Oregon, stretching from Prineville to Enterprise.\n As the National Guard was cleaning up the Willamette Valley, and the ORA was digging in around Eastern Oregon, many feared that Oregon was soon going to be having its own version of the Russian Civil War. That was until Baker. George Luis Baker, born in 1868, had been the mayor of Portland since 1917. When Oregon declared itself a Republic earlier in the year, he had stepped down from his office in favor of playing to a higher degree of politics. Shortly after stepping down as Mayor of Portland, Baker, along with members of the Democratic Party, the Oregon Klan, the Masonic Grand Lodge of Oregon and various Share Our Wealth Societies formed the 'Oregon Democratic People's Party'. Just as the ORA was preparing for their Revolution, Baker was going around Oregon, giving speeches, shaking hands and the like, in preparation for the upcoming 1932 elections. However, when the ORA began their uprising, Baker was not silent. He began giving speech after speech denouncing the Communists, calling all Oregonians to rise up and crush the 'Greatest threat to our way of life' and this call did not fall on deaf ears. All around the former State militias began to form in response to both Baker's call and the seeming lack of willingness of the Oregon National Guard to deal with the ORA past the Cascades. These militias, made up of veterans of the Great War, simple farmers, die hard ideologues and chapters of the Klan were loyal solely to Baker and his ODPP.\n As the National Guard and ORA both began to solidify the ground that they had taken, the ORA in the East was suddenly attacked by the ODPP's militias! The militias were merciless in their attacks on the ORA, in fact, in several cases, ORA members who surrendered were executed, in clear extrajudicial faction. Furthermore, in towns taken by militias made up of Klansmen it was not unheard of for both Blacks and Catholics to \"disappear\" overnight. As the ORA was being attacked by ODPP militias, the National Guard was quick to take advantage, and they crossed the Cascades, making quick work of the Reds.\n It was in the early part of March, 1934, that Reed ordered all ORA units to retreat to the \"Cascade Base Area\", a small stretch of land smack dab in the middle of the mountain range that split Oregon in two. He did this at the behest of the Soviet Military Mission that had been slowly flooding into Oregon since the start of the uprising. This marked the effective end of the CPO's \"revolution\".\n Since the recall order, the CPO and it's ORA have not been heard from. Following the retreat of the ORA, those militias belonging to the ODPP and National Guard almost ended in a war themselves, as the National Guard demanded that the militias stand-down and relinquish their firearms. The only thing that stopped this from turning into a second uprising was the \"Militia Act of 1934\", an act which was forced through the Oregon Legislature by the ODPP, both by using the seats they had as well as bribery, blackmail, and other such tools. The act states that militias, as long as the pose no threat to the Republic or it's people, have the legal right to exist.\n In 1934-35, after the uprising was dealt with, the Republican Constitution was drafted. Little was changed in between it and the State Constitution, save for the addition of a Bill of Rights. 1934 was also the year the first elections of the Republic took place. The clear winner was the Oregon Democratic-Republican Party, a merger of the old Republican and Democratic parties(the two merged for national stability in 1933) Julius Meier, the man who had led Oregon to her nationhood, was reelected with a clear majority. As for other parties, the ODPP was able to sway about a third of the electorate, giving them the ability to make or break any bill that goes through the legislature."

    ORIN.3.t:0 "Report on the Communist Party of Oregon"
    ORIN.3.d:0 "Founded as a merger of the Socialist Party of Oregon and the elements of the CPUSA active in Oregon, the Oregon Communist Party is viewed as the biggest threat to the budding Republic. Almost toppling the Republic in the first of her existence, the CPO and her Oregon Red Army is the only banned political party within Oregon. The CPO and the ORA is not alone at all in it’s quest to bring the Worker’s Revolution to Oregon. Soviet Advisors, in the form of a military mission, an economic advisory board and a handful of political commissars are seen as the main reason the the CPO is still afloat.\n  Lead by John Reed,the \”American Lenin\” the CPO, to the outsider, is a prime example of the Iron will and Iron displence required by a Communist. Once an order is given, it is followed without question and without reservation. However, this could not be further from the truth. The CPO is a highly fractured entity, lending to how they were founded and the advisors sent by the USSR. Save for the Commissars, the advisors all had different ideas on how the Soviet government should be organized. As a result they were \”encouraged\” by the Soviet government to leave with the military mission, lest they meet the same fate as many other dissidents with the Worker’s State\n The largest of these is the Reformist faction, led by Reed’s wife, Louise Bryant. The Reformists, while still wanting to rid Oregon of the Republican government, wish to slowly bring about the change to socialism, instead of doing away with capitalism overnight. The smallest and strangest of these factions is the so-called Mladorossist faction. Led by a group calling themselves \”The People’s Regency Council\”, the Mladorossists wish to create a People’s Tsardom, and use Oregon as a springboard to show the world that Soviet Monarchism can be victorious, and reunite the Disunited States.\n Overall, the CPO is a sleeping giant, lying in wait to strike when we expect it least...

    ORIN.4.t:0 "Report on the Oregon Democratic People's Party"
    ORIN.4.d:0 "Following Oregon’s succession along with California and Washington from the Union, the political landscape of the state-turned-nation was in utter and complete shock. In order to avoid a complete meltdown of the political situation, the Oregon Democratic and Republican parties were merged, to form the Democratic-Republican Party. While the merger was mostly painless, not all Democratic politicians, especially those of a more consertive and authoritarian bent, accepted the merger. At the head of these men was George Luis Baker. Baker had been the mayor of Portland since 1917, but when he learned of the merging of the two largest parties, stepped down and decried the merger as an illegal attempt by Meier to consolidate his power. Other democrats were quick to join in his protests, and on May 21st 1932 the Oregon Democratic People’s Party was born. Although the move brought Baker some popularity, the ODPP had the support of only a fraction of Oregon’s population. In order to improve this, Baker decided to make use of the various connections he had over the years in order to grow the party. In short order, the various Oregon chapters of the Klu Klux Klan, the Oregon Grand Masonic Lodge and various Share Our Wealth Societies either endorsed, joined or merged with the ODPP.\n Before the failed revolt of the Communist Party of Oregon, Baker had been touring Oregon, giving speech after speech, railing against corruption,foreign and Jewish influences, and offering sweet sounding solutions to the people. When he learned of the uprising, Baker’s already anticommunist rhetoric was turned up to 10, calling on all Oregonians to rise up and smash the Red Menace, and indeed this call was answered. The various Klan chapters, farmers and simple country folk all joined together to defeat any enemy their government seemingly refused too. After the uprising was crushed by the National Guard with aid from the ODPP militias, it seemed that a second uprising was bound to break out, as the National Guard demanded that the ODPP militias disarm and return home. However this was thankfully avoided by the passage of the Militia Act of 1934.\n During the 1934 elections, the ODPP, while losing the election of both the Governorship and the Legislature, were able to get a third of all seats within both Houses, giving the ODPP the ability to make or break any bill they feel like./n Ideologically, it is hard to pin down just what the ODPP stands for. While it is clear they stand for anticommunism and some kind of nationalism, that is where the clarity stops. The ODPP has to this day never published any kind of manifesto, all they have to offer is Baker’s speeches. Even then, they hardly clear anything up. One man could listen to Baker give a speech and hear promises of lower taxes and less government interference, while another man could hear promises to rid Oregon of Jews, Blacks and Catholics. This kind of confusion could easily be called laziness or a lack of real solutions. Leaked internal party documents seem to confirm this, as Baker in a letter to the ODPP’s leadership, the lack of clarity allows him to gain the support of almost anyone, as they hear what they want to hear.\n Despite this, due to how the ODPP was founded, many are using it as a tool to get their own ideas to come to power in Oregon. To be exact, three factions exist within the ODPP, the Klanists, the Loyalists or Bakerites and the Moderates or the Longites. The Klanists wish to see Oregon cleansed of the same influences as Baker, but unlike Baker who wishes to do things over time, the Klan wishes to use the sword to crush them. The Loyalists are the bulk of the party, and loyal to Baker, with some willing to do anything to please their Great Leader. The Longites follow an ideology close to that of Huey Long, the smallest faction, were the ODPP to ever come to full power, it is likely they would be the first target of the purges that are bound to follow a Loyalist or Klanist victory.
