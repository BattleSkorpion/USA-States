  virginia.4.d:0 "Van Horn Mosley has been meeting with many high ranking officers in our military. We've only recently been tipped off about these meetings by an officer that is either loyal or dissatisfied with Mosely. We are not yet sure how long these meetings have been going on for or what is being planned in them, but surely they cannot be good for the state. Now that we know about them, many of our advisors recommend we put a stop to these meetings."

  virginia.25.d:0 "Before the War of Southern Indepedence West Virginia used to be part of our Dominion. However, during the War the land was quickly occupided by federals who then created a state from Unionist traitors to form the what today is West Virginia. While Virginians have seen this loss as the price of defeat many now wonder if we should retake our former terrority. Afterall, West Virginia is very poor and weak. Byrdism is based on rural control so perhaps we can use a takeover of them to increase our power base. On the otherhand Virginians don't truely desire a war. What shall our Governor do?"
