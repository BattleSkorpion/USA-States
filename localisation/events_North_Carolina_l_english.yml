Pelly is well known for his anti-semimitism and religious extremeism across the country. The man rose only recently being inspired by Mussolini and other European dictators. While him and his Silvershirts don't share all our values they do hate communism. On top of that they are outsiders who are rather disliked by the North Eastern Elite.
