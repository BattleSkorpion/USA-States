    oklahoma.1.t:0 "The Red River Incident"
    oklahoma.1.d:0 "Earlier this week, a Texan fisherman was found on the wrong side of the Red River, on our side. While we would have normally escorted him back to Texas, the National Guard Soldier stationed near the area believed that it wasn't actually a fisherman who crossed, but rather a Texan Soldier. Because of this mistake, he shot the fisherman - killing him instantly. \n\n The National Guard Soldier defends himself stating that the light blanket of fog that surrounded the river that day impaired his judgement and that he didn't want to take any chances. \n\n Texas believes that this incident is enough to warrant war with Oklahoma. This statement does not seem to merely an empty threat as many National Guard Soldiers stationed on the boarder noticed the Texan Boarder Guard growing in size day by day, to the point where many fear that Texas is planning and prepared to invade Oklahoma within just a couple of weeks. \n\n Many of the higher ups in the country wish to call on Louisiana for aid in protecting our country."

    oklahoma.4.d:0 "For around 2 weeks now, our troops have been amassing on the Oklahoman boarder by themselves. They are amassing on Oklahoma's boarder for a very good reason, however. Around 2 weeks ago a Texan fisherman was shot on the Red River, he was mistaken as a soldier because of the dense fog that day. Most of the people in Texas supports their decision and many are calling for war, this is the last time Oklahoma will spit in our face or even dare to stand before us!"
