    OS.0.t:0 "Communists Seize Springfield"
    OS.0.d:0  "Just as many in the upper echelons of the National Guard feared, the Oregon Red Army has finally made a move, and under the shadow of darkness, seized the city of Springfield. This gives them a base from which to strike Salem with. The Red Army is still on the move however, and Governor Meier is expected to respond any minute now..."
    OS.0.a:0 "Those Damn Reds!"

    OS.1.t:0 "Governor Meier Declares Martial Law"
    OS.1.d:0 "With Communist forces only a scant few hours from Salem,Governor Meier has decided too, with little legal basis, declared that the entirety of Oregon, from Astoria to Rome, is now under martial law. He is hoping above all, that with no legislative oversight, he will be able to crush the rebels once and for all!"
    OS.1.a:0 "Let us hope he is right"

    OS.2.t:0 "Portland and Astoria fall to Communist forces"
    OS.2.d:0 "Horrible News! The Oregon Red Army, despite the National Guard putting up a valiant defense, have taken Portland! What is worse, our port city in the mouth of the Columbia, Astoria was also taken by Communist forces in a surprise attack! With the loss of Portland and Astoria, the Reds completely control shipping on the Oregon side of the Columbia. It also appears that the Soviet Union, watching all of this, and perhaps even commanding it, from afar have begun sending the ORA shipments of arms, ammo and food."
    OS.2.a:0 "Dammit!"
   
    OS.3.t:0 "Reed proclaims the Socialist Republic of Oregon"
    OS.3.d:0 "Following the stunning victories of the Oregon Red Army in the past few weeks,  John Reed, Chairman of the Oregon Communist Party, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Oregon, laying claim to the whole of Oregon. As of now, a state of uneasy peace, much like the peace between the Union and Confederacy before the American Civil War took off, exists in Oregon. This may be the last glimpse of peace Oregon will see for years to come..."
    OS.3.a:0 "OREGON WILL NEVER FALL TO COMMUNIST INVASION!"
    OS.3.b:0 "Workers of Oregon, your liberation is here!"
    
    OS.4.t:0 "George Baker issues the 'Baker Declaration'"
    OS.4.d:0 "Geroge Baker, former mayor of Portland and founder of the Oregon Democratic People's Party, is a name that has become increasingly known within Oregon. Ever since the Republic of Oregon was declared, Baker has emerged at the forefront of the Oregon rightwing. A Populist, Baker is known for his fiery oratory. This much was proved a short few hours ago, when Baker gave a fiery speech in the small eastern oregon town of Baker. In his speech, Baker heavily and wholeheartedly denounced the Communists, calling them 'Rapid dogs, only worthy of being shot.' He also denounced  the Salem government  just as heavily,  calling us 'A bunch of useless men sitting around arguing about how to deal with Reds, instead of just shooting them.' He went on to describe his dream for Oregon:One free of Communists, Liberals and 'Jewish Influences'. He also said that this dream would not, and in fact, could not, stop at the Columbia and Snake rivers. This dream he said, must encompass ALL of Oregon. He ended his speech by issuing the 'Baker Declaration' a document laying down the basis for a new government of Oregon, as well as putting his ideas into practice. Baker's message, of a new Oregon for and by Oregonians, resonates heavily with the people of Eastern Oregon, and in fact the majority of counties in Eastern Oregon have pledged themselves to Baker and his Declaration."

    OS.5.t:0 "Eastern Oregon rises: the Unitary Republic of Oregon proclaimed"
    OS.5.d:0 "Following the issuing of the Baker Declaration, the past few days and weeks have seen a massive spike in travel to the Eastern portion of the state. We now know why. Baker and his goons in the ODPP have been moving men and arms to Eastern Oregon in preparation for their revolt, which took place this morning. Much like with the communists, an uneasy peace is still felt in the air, but all it takes is a spark to light a powderkeg...."
    OS.5.a:0 "This can't get much worse..."
    OS.5.b:0 "For an Oregon free of corruption!"
    
    OS.6.t:0 "Southern Oregon declares independence"
    OS.6.d:0 "Following the declaration of Martial Law, southern Oregon, a  temperate and politically moderate region, although being loyal to Salem, whispers of independence could be heard agmoust the populus. Despite these whispers, southern Oregon stayed with Salem, hoping that the Reds would be dealt with soon, and that republican government would soon return to Oregon. However, when the Reds solidified themselves in the SRO, the dreams of a quick return to normalcy faded.  However, due to the SRO being isolated to the Willamette Valley, those in the southern part of Oregon expected that little fighting would take place in their neck of the woods, and so the whispers, although growing louder, were still just that, whispers. With the rise of the Unitary Republic however, this changed. Fighting would be taking place all over Oregon, and with that knowledge, the southern counties could take no more. The southern counties have formally severed all ties with the Salem government, and declared independence from the Republic of Oregon. Together, the counties have formed the Jeffersonian Republic, and have laid claim to northern California, stating that the northern Californians have suffered similar tyranny as themselves. The Salem government is now reduced to a small strip of the coast and Marian and Linn counties."

    OS.7.t:0 "The John Day Massacre"
    OS.7.d:0 "Following the foundation of our glorious nation, the ODPP as they rightly should have, assumed all control over all functions of government, abolishing all power structures, save for the Party-State. Doing this has granted ODPP militias almost unlimited power in regards to judicial activities. One such militia, loyal to the Ku Klux Klan faction of the party, has exercised this power with unmatched bloodiness. The militia had rounded up 3000 Papists, Blacks and other degenerates. These 3000 were marched from all around the Unitary Republic and taken to the small town of John Day. Once they arrived, the 3000 were paraded throughout the town, as townsfolk hurled insults, and the occasional rock. At the end of the marching, all were either hung, shot or set on fire and left to burn alive. Some of the Papists died screaming ‘Long Live Christ the King!’ However horrific, President Baker is slow to condemn the action, as his long term plan for Oregon is to put an end to these same people. Not through killing them, but through generations. Despite this, the incident is bound to spread outside of our borders, and Baker’s inaction may prove fatal."
