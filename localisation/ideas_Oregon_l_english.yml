  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk_desc:0 "In 1933, the front lines of the Oregon Civil War had become solidified, leading the various claimant governments to start focusing on internal matters. Two of these 'matters' for the Unitary Republic of Oregon were the 'Catholic Question' and the 'Negro Question'. The answers to these questions was perhaps the most hotly debated topic within the ODPP. However, the party never reached a solution. That was, of course, until the section of the party that was whole heartily devoted to the politics of the Ku Klux Klan took matters into their own hands. They rounded up some 3000 Catholics, African-Americans and other 'degenerates' and brought them to the small town of John Day and summarily executed all 3000 persons. This lead to the revolt of Catholics in Baker, African-Americans in Pendleton, as well as a small group of Americanist minded lumbermen and farmers in Wallowa County. Which, after a series of hard-fought battles, lead to the creation of the Principality of Oregon, the Republic of Neo Afrika and the Provisional Government of Cascadia. On his part, President Baker denounced the actions of the Klan, and purged the ODPP's ranks of all known or thought to belong to Klan. The Klan of course, did not take kindly to do this, and revolted. The revolt was highly unsuccessful, only being able to hold onto the southern third of Malheur County. The John Day Massacre may have been three years ago, but it's legacy is alive and well to the citizens of Eastern Oregon."
