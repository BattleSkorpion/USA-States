  ORE_civlwar_econ_isshit_desc:0 "Ever since the Oregon Civil War first broke out in 1931, the various economies of the Oregon claimants have been geared for one thing: War. This had lead to an increse in Arms Production at the cost of basic needs for Citzens."
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk:0 "Legacy of the John Day Massacre"
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk_desc:0 "In 1933, the front lines of the Oregon Civil War had become solidified, leading the various claimant governments to start focusing on internal matters. Two of these 'matters' for the Unitary Republic of Oregon were the 'Catholic Question' and the 'Negro Question'. The answers to these questions was perhaps the most hotly debated topic within the ODPP. However, the party never reached a solution. That was, of course, until the section of the party that was whole heartily devoted to the politics of the Ku Klux Klan took matters into their own hands. They rounded up some 3000 Catholics, African-Americans and other 'degenerates' and brought them to the small town of John Day and summarily executed all 3000 persons. This lead to the revolt of Catholics in Baker, African-Americans in Pendleton, as well as a small group of Americanist minded lumbermen and farmers in Wallowa County. Which, after a series of hard-fought battles, lead to the creation of the Principality of Oregon, the Republic of Neo Afrika and the Provisional Government of Cascadia. On his part, President Baker denounced the actions of the Klan, and purged the ODPP's ranks of all known or thought to belong to Klan. The Klan of course, did not take kindly to do this, and revolted. The revolt was highly unsuccessful, only being able to hold onto the southern third of Malheur County. The John Day Massacre may have been three years ago, but it's legacy is alive and well to the citizens of Eastern Oregon."

  POO_Torch_Bearing:0 "Bearers of the Torch"
  POO_Torch_Bearing_desc:0 "The Portland Commune stands as the sole Anarchist society in North America, the sole bearer of the Tourch of True Liberty, in perhaps the whole world. This is something we are willing to die for."
  POO_is_fucked:0 "Gridlocked Council"
  POO_is_fucked_desc:0 "The Portland Commune is ruled by the Portland Worker's Council, a body of elected representatives from every neighborhood, trade union, guild etc. These representatives all work tirelessly and selflessly for the betterment and glory of the entire Commune, and if they don't, the people who elected them can recall them in an instant, and it works flawlessly, at least on paper. In reality, the Council has been in gridlock since it's birth in 1932, after Portland proclaimed itself independent from Oregon(in fact, Portland's declaration of independence is so far the only act ever pushed through the Council). The Council itself has become the butt of a common joke for the people of Portland: 'You're working as almost as hard as the Council!'" 
  POO_isso_fucked:0 "Political Chaos"
  POO_isso_fucked_desc:0 "Despite the Council nominally being the sole legal political entity in the Commune, due to the constant gridlock, three distinct political systems rule in Portland. Namely, a strong stalinist state, led by the Council of People's Commissars (a group who's funding from the Socialist Republic of Oregon is an open-secret), the old democratic mayoral system, led by newly elected mayor Oswald West (who is in fact a former governor of Oregon) and a true Anarcho-Syndicalist society. Due to how the Worker's Council is organized, these three states exist in an almost constant state of small-scale warfare, fighting in hopes of gaining control of a neighborhood or trade union in order to gain full control of the Council, thus gaining full power over the entirety of Portland. However, whenever one neighborhood is taken by one faction, that same faction will no doubt lose a neighborhood of their own. The sole reason Portland has not collapsed entirely is due to the Socialist Republic of Oregon's promise to protect the independence of the Portland Commune"  
  POO_eco_fucked:0 "Economic Boom"
  POO_eco_fucked_desc:0 "A strange plus of the anarchy that is the Portland Commune is that some neighborhoods have fallen under the control of certain corporations, be them local or outsiders. This brings a boon to the economy due to the perfect libertarian poltical and economic conditions brought on by the anarchy. However the safety of workers is little more than a suggestion in these neighborhoods.."
  ORE_Civil_War:0 "The Oregon Civil War"
  ORE_Civil_War_desc:0 "Trench apon Trench. Charge apon useless charge. The stench of death everywhere. This is not describing anything from The Great War. This is in fact life for people in Oregon, a land gripped by an endless civil war since 1931. In December 1929, Oregon along with Califorina and Washington seceded from the Union and formed the Pacific States of America due DC's handling of the Great Depression. On May 1st, following a failled coup, Communist Parties in California begin an uprising to size control of the state and transform the PSA into a communist state. In December 1930, fearing a communist victory in California, Governor Julius Meier declares Martial Law. This comes to late, as Red Army forces, until the command of John Reed had already entered the state. On January 3rd, 1931, the newly formed Socialist Republic of Oregon proclaim victory, even though they only controlled half of the state. On January 31st, the 'Compromise of the Pacific' is signed by the remains of the PSA and Red California, Disbanding the PSA and granting Oregon independence. On the same day, former mayor of Portland, George Baker issues the 'Baker Declaration' decrying both Salem and the Socialist Republic of Oregon, proclaiming the Unitary Republic of Oregon. For the next two years constant fighting takes place around the state, with borders slowly being soildifed around a network of trenches. On April 26th 1934 Klamath, Jackson, Curry and Coos Counties declare independence and proclaim the Jeffersonian Republic, laying claim to Northern California. The last major offense of the civil war so far was the Klamath Offensive. Taking place between January-March 1935. The Oregon civil war may be paused, but it is far from over."

  ORE_Cristero_Spirit_desc:0 "From 1926 to 1929, faithful Mexican Catholics fought tooth and nail to restore the Church of Christ to it's rightful place in society, a concept alien to the atheistic goverment of Plutarco Calles who thought to snuff out the Church by force of arms. La Cristiada produced hundreds, if not thousands, of saints. We, the Catholic Faithful of Oregon, are the heirs of the Cristero Spirit! The Blood of the John Day Martyrs will be avenged! Viva Cristo Rey!"   
  ORE_Greater_Oregon:0 "Greater Oregon Dreams"
  ORE_Greater_Oregon_desc:0 "While the main reasoning behind Baker's revolt was to create an Oregon free of Communism and 'Jewish Influences' he has never been shy in stating that this dream will not be contained in the borders created by the Compromise of the Pacific. Baker's dream, he says, will be spread to Oregon's 'natural borders', the Oregon Country of old."
  ORE_Portland_Question:0 "The Portland Question"
  ORE_Portland_Question_desc:0 "When the IWW seized control of Portland in 1932 and proclaimed the Portland Commune, the Socialist Republic of Oregon was quick to recognize the new Worker's State. In private, Chairman Reed said that Portland could be a 'useful idiot' and would be a good ally. However, when Portland's Worker Council become gridlocked and Portland itself fell into anarchy, Reed started to choak on his words. The SRO was in a tough spot:They could either go back on their promise and easily annex the city, at the cost of legitmancy in the eyes of Oregonians, or they could keep their promise, and sink endless resources into the city, in the hopes that one day Portland would fix itself. Chairman Reed choice a middleground. The SRO would keep Portland independent state, while 'covertly' funding allies in the city, in hopes they could take over the city and join the Socialist Republic as an Autonomous Socialist Republic. However, the people of Portland were quick to discover that the SRO was funding the imfamous 'Council of People's Commissars' but due to the policital choas in Portland, no unified effort has ever been made to stop the shipments of arms, food and money. Chairman Reed's 'solution' to the Portland question is no solution at all. Reed will have to find a true solution to the Portland question soon, or he may not stay Chairman for long..."
  ORE_Powerless_Dudes:0 "Powerless Legislature"
  ORE_Powerless_Dudes_desc:0 "Due to either genuine democratic impulses, or because he hasn't gotten around to it, Governor Meier has allowed the democratic legislature to exist, and even hold elections, but these are limited to the small amount of Oregon controlled by the Salem government. Despite these elections, the legislature holds no power over the government.  However, there are whispers that newly elected senate majority leader William U'Ren will attempt to remove Meier from office, either legally or with the use of the National Guard. U'ren is a very progressive man, and if he were to come to power it is likely he would attempt to make peace with the Socialist Republic of Oregon, but that is if even wants to come to power, as he denies the rumors of planning a coup, at least for now...

  ORE_beaver_state_desc:0 "If the past 100 years have proved anything, it is that Oregon can endure. We endured the American Civil War. We endured the fall of the Union. We endured the fall of the PSA. The so called Socialist 'Republic' would see everything the USA stood for banished! The Unitary 'Republic' would see Oregonians bled for land we haven't controlled for almost 100 years! The Catholics would have us become somesort of damn Papist Theocracy! The Klan would see democractic government's heart ripped out and stomped! The Casadaicans would Oregon lose it's indenity to a so-called 'Bioregion!' ENOUGH! We will end these upstarts and restore the true government of the state of Oregon! We will once again flies with our own wings or die trying! WE SHALL STAND FIRM!"
