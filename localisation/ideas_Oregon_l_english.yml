  ORE_civlwar_econ_isshit_desc:0 "Ever since the Oregon Civil War first broke out in 1931, the various economies of the Oregon claimants have been geared for one thing: War. This had lead to an increse in Arms Production at the cost of basic needs for Citzens."
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk:0 "Legacy of the John Day Massacre"
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk_desc:0 "In 1933, the front lines of the Oregon Civil War had become solidified, leading the various claimant governments to start focusing on internal matters. Two of these 'matters' for the Unitary Republic of Oregon were the 'Catholic Question' and the 'Negro Question'. The answers to these questions was perhaps the most hotly debated topic within the ODPP. However, the party never reached a solution. That was, of course, until the section of the party that was whole heartily devoted to the politics of the Ku Klux Klan took matters into their own hands. They rounded up some 3000 Catholics, African-Americans and other 'degenerates' and brought them to the small town of John Day and summarily executed all 3000 persons. This lead to the revolt of Catholics in Baker, African-Americans in Pendleton, as well as a small group of Americanist minded lumbermen and farmers in Wallowa County. Which, after a series of hard-fought battles, lead to the creation of the Principality of Oregon, the Republic of Neo Afrika and the Provisional Government of Cascadia. On his part, President Baker denounced the actions of the Klan, and purged the ODPP's ranks of all known or thought to belong to Klan. The Klan of course, did not take kindly to do this, and revolted. The revolt was highly unsuccessful, only being able to hold onto the southern third of Malheur County. The John Day Massacre may have been three years ago, but it's legacy is alive and well to the citizens of Eastern Oregon."

  ORE_Race_Warism_desc:0 "Due to the focus on racial policies by our government, tension is growing between Whites and Blacks within our borders. As of right now, little is happening. However, if left uncheck, we could have a full-blown race war on our hands..."
  POO_Torch_Bearing:0 "Bearers of the Torch"
  POO_Torch_Bearing_desc:0 "The Portland Commune stands as the sole Anarchist society in North America, the sole bearer of the Tourch of True Liberty, in perhaps the whole world. This is something we are willing to die for."
  POO_is_fucked:0 "Gridlocked Council"
  POO_is_fucked_desc:0 "The Portland Commune is ruled by the Portland Worker's Council, a body of elected representatives from every neighborhood, trade union, guild etc. These representatives all work tirelessly and selflessly for the betterment and glory of the entire Commune, and if they don't, the people who elected them can recall them in an instant, and it works flawlessly, at least on paper. In reality, the Council has been in gridlock since it's birth in 1932, after Portland proclaimed itself independent from Oregon(in fact, Portland's declaration of independence is so far the only act ever pushed through the Council). The Council itself has become the butt of a common joke for the people of Portland: 'You're working as almost as hard as the Council!'" 
  POO_isso_fucked:0 "Political Chaos"
  POO_isso_fucked_desc:0 "Despite the Council nominally being the sole legal political entity in the Commune, due to the constant gridlock, three distinct political systems rule in Portland. Namely, a strong stalinist state, led by the Council of People's Commissars (a group who's funding from the Socialist Republic of Oregon is an open-secret), the old democratic mayoral system, led by newly elected mayor Oswald West (who is in fact a former governor of Oregon) and a true Anarcho-Syndicalist society. Due to how the Worker's Council is organized, these three states exist in an almost constant state of small-scale warfare, fighting in hopes of gaining control of a neighborhood or trade union in order to gain full control of the Council, thus gaining full power over the entirety of Portland. However, whenever one neighborhood is taken by one faction, that same faction will no doubt lose a neighborhood of their own. The sole reason Portland has not collapsed entirely is due to the Socialist Republic of Oregon's promise to protect the independence of the Portland Commune"  
  POO_eco_fucked:0 "Economic Boom"
  POO_eco_fucked_desc:0 "A strange plus of the anarchy that is the Portland Commune is that some neighborhoods have fallen under the control of certain corporations, be them local or outsiders. This brings a boon to the economy due to the perfect libertarian poltical and economic conditions brought on by the anarchy. However the safety of workers is little more than a suggestion in these neighborhoods.."
