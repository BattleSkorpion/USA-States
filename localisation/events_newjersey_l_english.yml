    newjersey.1.t: "A Fracturing Union" 
    newjersey.1.d: "By late 1932 the situation in America was becoming increasingly desperate. The Hoover administration's lackluster policy of 'Unity Through Peace' had allowed almost all the states west of the Mississippi to secede by the end of 31' without any obstruction whatsoever. By the end of November in 32', we and Washington D.C. were the last strongholds of the union in the Atlantic. It was clear that if there was any hope left of saving the union, doing it through peaceful means were entirely out of the question. In early December a plan to occupy Delaware, and eventually retake several key states was hastily drafted on the order of Governor Harry Moore, which was then presented to Hoover and his cabinet. Although reluctant, Hoover agreed, and on December 25th our forces marched into Wilmington, facing little resistance on account of the holiday. By the first week of January we had captured all of Delaware while forces in D.C. were making their way to Baltimore. The first stage of our grand plan to retake the union was going well until Governor Moore, in all of his arrogance, demanded that New Jersey have her state border moved to the Susquehanna River, which would swallow all of Delaware and a 1/3 of Maryland. Hoover dismissed the idea, saying that it was not relevant to the matter at hand, however Moore would not let go so easily. After D.C. forces failed to take Baltimore, Hoover called on our military to march into Maryland, which Moore, refusing to swallow his pride, refused. Without our help and Virginia joining the conflict, Hoover's forces were pushed back to D.C., being relegated to a city state. After squashing D.C., the combined forces of Maryland and Virginia pushed us out of Delaware, with our forces narrowly escaping total antihalation through Pennsylvania. After the defeat in Delaware, Moore signed a peace pact with our enemies, promising to disarm our forces and become an ally to them. Our army would not let Moore's actions go unpunished, and on March 13th, they bravely led a coup against Governor Moore, promising to take revenge..."

Our intelligence reports tell us that only a few thousand ill-equipped men have landed, yet in New Jersey these landings are being hailed as the rebirth of the Union!"

    newjersey.9.t: "Maryland Sends Us an Ultimatum!" 
    newjersey.9.d: "We've recieved an ultimatum, written by the Governor of Maryland himself, telling us to withdraw our forces or face total annihilation. He insists that we stand no chance, and this will only serve to hurt both of our nations. He went on to say that what happened in 33' should be left in the past, and that we should work with eachother, not against. What he does not understand is that this isn't about revenge, its about keeping America alive! In the closing part of the letter, he wrote: 'It's over Schwarzkopf, I have the advantage!'"
    newjersey.9.a: "You underestimate my power!"
