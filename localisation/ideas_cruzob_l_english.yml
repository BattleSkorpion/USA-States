  MQR_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "We are surronded by Yucateco collaborators, White landowners and the outside world does not want to see a indigenous Maya state beat the capitalist financial order. This is a struggle for life and death. If the Mexicans and their collaborator allies win, the Maya race will be almost certainly exterminated or driven to the point of squalor and humilation. Freedom or Death!"

  MQR_native_infighting_desc:0 "The Maya have always been prone to infighting, even before times of Spanish Conquest. But these infighting issues have been exasterbated by the Mexican/Spainard strategy of divide and conquer. This strategy has been completly effective towards us in the past and wielded devastating results to our population. We must unite the Maya and other sympathetic Indigenous people to fight the true enemy of Colonization and prevent more Indigenous people joining the Colonizer's side as collaborators."
