  arkansas.7.d:0 "Democrats have split but this time offically. While the Klan won the Democratic Primary they will face young reformer Fulbright in the general election. Fulbright was an educator fired by Cazhort due to political drama with his family. As a result Bailey has taken him under his wing. Likewise the Klan faction has been taken over by former Little Rock Sheriff, Homer Adins, a true believer in Klan idealogy. Suprisingly they face a strong Republican coliltiion of Progressives, moderates and Socialists lead by longterm STFU member and socialist Sam Faubus."
