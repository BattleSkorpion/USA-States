On Jan 4,1933 Sholtz was inaugerated as the First President of Florida's second Republic, the First Florida Republic in 1861. Under Sholtz's direction Florida has introduced school books and numerous social programs. However, while being popular with the common people the conservative state legislators have done their most to block his programs in the Senate and Congress. On top of this they have blocked his attempt to remove the no consecutive term law for Governors. Sholtz has the support needed however with the Florida Army to stay if he so wished."
