  cartel.1.d:0 "After the Mexican Revolution, Amelio Flores was still a relativly unkown person in Mexico. It was only after World War I that he started to make gains using his incredable charisma and ability to persuade people to believe anything. He was not able to make full use of his ability while there was a mostly stable government, only gaining a small cult-like following during the 1920s. Once the Great Depression broke out, however, the United States began to fall apart. Inspired by these rebellions - and the now very weak Mexican government and economy - many Mexican states in the hinterlands began to fight for independence as well. It was during these times of great need that people turned to Amelio Flores for guidance. Amelio Flores promised the world and more to his followers in his vision of a perfect society. It was in his birth state of Jalisco that Amelio's vision was followed by the masses the most, enough to actract those who would die for Amelio's cuase, those who would fight another Meixcan Revolution. In late 1933 such a second Mexican Revolution occured. Early on, it was an uphill battle with Amelio's followers struggling to gain an upper hand on the Mexican government, however, that's when Amelio met Juan Nepomuceno Guerra. Juan Nepomuceno Guerra was someone looking to make a lot of money by creating a cartel, the first of its kind. He was already fairly wealthy thanks to his alcohol smuggling into the breakaway Southern States from the former United States. Juan promised to use his considerable wealth to fund Amelio's revolution, if Amelio promised to find a place for Juan and his buddies in the new society Amelio was planning to build. Evven though they did not agree on everything, Amelio agreed to make a place for Juan in his society. With Juan's funding, Amelio's Revolution was finally able to gain ground against the weak Mexican government and, over the course of 1 year, eventualy came to control the northern Mexican states that weren't already break away, as well as the top half of Veracruz. Many of the people in the now called \"Cartels\" did not appreciate Juan or Amelio ruling over them. Amelio's policies of atheism, especiialy, caused instability in much of the new country. After only existing for 2 years, instability promises to tear The Cartels apart even quicker than they sized power.\n\nVeracruz has proven to be the most instable part of The Cartels, being a thorn in the country's side since North Veracruz was conquored by Amelio's Revolutionaries. If nothing is done soon, the memories of Amelio's great country may fade into history, leaving little trace on the world."
