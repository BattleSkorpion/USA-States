  cartel.0.d:0 "The Cartels has never been the most stable country. With a revolutionary upbringing and questionable economic princibles, the people have never been too receptive to the leader or his advisors. The country is in a state of near constate revolt and only through reform or careful politicking can this country hold together. If the country falls apart it seems very likely that the ruler will die along with his country in another, firey revolutoin."

  cartel.1.t:0 "History of the Country"
  cartel.1.d:0 "Before the Mexican Revolution, Amelio Flores was a relativly unkown person in Mexico. It was only after the Mexican Revolution that he started to make gains using his incredable charisma and ability to persuade people to believe almost anything he told them. He slowly gained a small cult-like following throughout the 1920s. Once the Great Depression broke out and the United States began to fall apart, Amelio's prospects began to grow. Inspired by these rebellions - and the now very weak Mexican government and economy - many Mexican states in the hinterlands began to fight for independence as well. It was during these times of great need that people turned to the charasmatic Amelio Flores for guidance. Amelio promised the world and more to his followers with his vision of a perfect society. It was in his birth state of Jalisco that Amelio's vision was accepted by the masses the most, enough to actract those who would fight for Amelio's cuase, those who would ignight another Meixcan Revolution. In late 1933 such a second Mexican Revolution occured. Early on, it was an uphill battle with Amelio's followers struggling to gain an upper hand on the Mexican government, however, that's when Amelio met Juan Nepomuceno Guerra. Juan Nepomuceno Guerra was someone looking to make a lot of money by creating a cartel, the first of its kind. He was already more wealthy than the average Mexican thanks to his alcohol and general illegal substacne smuggling into the breakaway Southern States from the former United States. Juan promised to use his wealth and connections to aid Amelio's revolution, if Amelio promised in return to find a place for Juan and his buddies in the new society Amelio was planning to build. Even though they did not see eye to eye at most times, Amelio agreed to make a place for Juan in his society. With Juan's funding and connections, Amelio's Revolution was finally able to gain ground against the weak Mexican government and, over the course of 1 year, eventualy came to control the northern Mexican states that weren't already break away, as well as the northern half of Veracruz. The only problem was, many of the people in the now called \"Cartels\" did not appreciate Juan or Amelio ruling over them, they didn't buy into Amelio's \"Great Society\" and Amelio's policy of \"Free Enterprise\", especiallly, were leaving many in poverty and unruly. After only existing for 2 years, instability promises to tear The Cartels apart even quicker than they sized power.\n\nVeracruz has proven to be the most instable part of The Cartels, being a thorn in the country's side since North Veracruz was conquored by Amelio's Revolutionaries. If nothing is done soon, the memories of Amelio's legacy may fade into history, leaving little trace on the world."
