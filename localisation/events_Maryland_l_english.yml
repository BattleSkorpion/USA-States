      maryland.1.d:0 "Late last night Governor Albert Ritchie died of a brain hemorrhage. Ritchie was the longest serving Governor as he’d started off being elected Governor in 1920. His death has shocked many as he was not quite yet an old man. On top of this many fear riots as Ritchie faced a tough election in 1934 which left many screaming that he cheated. In this power vacuum Field Marshal Pedro del Valle has stepped in declaring marshal law. The Maryland Guard has rallied behind Valle and seem to be aping the military junta of those dirty New Jersians. As the state has no Lt Governor to succeed Ritchie many have already accepted the General fearing a civil war would lead to federal invasion. ."

      maryland.6.t:0 "Chesapeake Bay War"
      maryland.6.d:0 "When the Union fell in 1932 it was not without bloodshed. In the dying days of the Union President Hoover backed by loyalist New Jersey choose to usurp Maryland on the eve of Christmas. That snowy day 2000 treasonous Maryland Guardsmen siezed Annapolis declaring secession illegal and arrested Governor Ritchie. Thus, began a quick occupation of Maryland by US General Douglas MacAuther whom became acting military Governor. With this the federal government began moving into Northern Virginia to bring the state back into the Union by force. The Chesapeake Bay War began on January the 2nd 1933. Despite this Marylanders held strong as a Maryland patriots siezed the captured Governor from federal hands. On February 2nd Ritchie gave a radio speech to 'throw the federal invader out of Maryland!'. The people quickly took up arms and sent General MacAuther fleeing to Baltimore. From there the Hooverite War effort collasped ending with a ceasefire on March 1st 1933."

      maryland.7.t:0 "Beware of New Jersey"
      maryland.7.d:0 "We must never forget New Jersey is an enemy. When the federals tried to destroy us in 1932 the New Jersey dog occupied Delaware for their greedy selves. However, New Jersey and the federals had an inner dispute as the New Jersey government sought to essentially annex Delaware into a ‘greater New Jersey’. Not just them but also the Eastern half of our own state which was then occupied by the cowardly General MacArthur. By February 1933 we had quickly retaken back control of our state to the shock of the New Jersey army in Delaware.  Virginia Volunteer forces wiped up South Delaware within a few days.  By the last week the New Jersey Army was surrounded West and South by combined forces of Virginia and Maryland. New Jersey sought to pull troops across the Bay but found themselves blocked by Pennsylvania navy angered by the tyrannical actions of those filthy stinking New Jerseys. Thus, New Jersey would agree to the March 1st ceasefire in threat of a destruction of their army.  Our forces were sad to watch those bastards escape death as they made their way, unarmed, into Pennsylvania back to Filth-a-dephia. Had General Valle or Governor Ritchie had their way we’d had finished them then and there. However, Virginia held us back. Within a month of the ceasefire the military of New Jersey took over the state. We now possibly face a return those devils……."
