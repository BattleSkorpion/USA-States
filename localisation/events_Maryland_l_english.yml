      maryland.1.d:0 "Late last night Governor Albert Ritchie died of a brain hemorrhage. Ritchie was the longest serving Governor as he’d started off being elected Governor in 1920. His death has shocked many as he was not quite yet an old man. On top of this many fear riots as Ritchie faced a tough election in 1934 which left many screaming that he cheated. In this power vacuum Field Marshal Pedro del Valle has stepped in declaring marshal law. The Maryland Guard has rallied behind Valle and seem to be aping the military junta of those dirty New Jersians. As the state has no Lt Governor to succeed Ritchie many have already accepted the General fearing a civil war would lead to federal invasion. ."

      maryland.6.d:0 "When the Union fell in 1932 it was not without bloodshed. In the dying days of the Union President Hoover backed by loyalist New Jersey choose to usurp Maryland on the eve of Christmas. That snowy day 2000 treasonous Maryland Guardsmen siezed Annapolis declaring secession illegal and arrested Governor Ritchie. Thus, began a quick occupation of Maryland by US General Douglas MacAuther whom became acting military Governor. With this the federal government began moving into Northern Virginia to bring the state back into the Union by force. The Chesapeake Bay War began on January the 2nd 1933. Despite this Marylanders held strong as a Maryland patriots siezed the captured Governor from federal hands. On February 2nd Ritchie gave a radio speech to 'throw the federal invader out of Maryland!'. The people quickly took up arms and sent General MacAuther fleeing to Baltimore. From there the Hooverite War effort collasped ending with a ceasefire on March 1st 1933."
