 chicago.1.t:0 "Socialists rise up in Chicago"
 chicago.1.d:0 "Ever since tensions between the Socialist Party of Illinois, and its supporters, and the Democratic Party of Illinois, and its supporters, began, it was typically believed that it would remain little more than an average political rivalry, however it appears that, today, hostilities have reached a peak. The socialists who have controlled Chicago since 1932, have finally decided that they’re sick of failing to make changes that suit their ideological agenda, and have established a military foothold in the surrounding region. Many sources are claiming that there’s already been outbreaks of violent conflict along the newly-established Illinois-Chicago border, but what is certain is that the socialists have taken up arms against Illinois and are most likely planning a total take-over of the state. If this war does come, it will be a long and difficult struggle for Chicago, having only limited military knowledge and men. Illinois, contradictive, holds the upper hand with immense equipment and men, and the knowledge necessary. The people across North America are already predicting the outcome many experts see most likely: an Illinoisian victory. In spite of this, it’s yet to be seen whether this action will actually spiral into a full war."
