    alabama.1.d:0 "Many outsiders consider Alabama gifted due to its current head of State Bibb Graves. Graves has been a leading voice of moderation in the further radicalizing South. A veteran of World War 1 and prior elected Governor in 1926, and nonConsecutively in 1934, Governor Graves has stood strong on his platform of helping the common man over the wealthy planters and industrialists of the state. While not in office in 1932 he was a leading unionist albeit his efforts to remain in the Union failed when Georgia seceded. While Alabama now remains an isolationist Republic many younger political factions remain in the shadows for the 1938 Governor election. In which Graves is unable to run."
    alabama.1.a:0 "A Good Governor!"
