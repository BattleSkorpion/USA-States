    alabama.1.t:0 "Our Governor"
    alabama.1.d:0 "Many outsiders consider Alabama gifted due to its current head of State Bibb Graves. Graves has been a leading voice of moderation in the further radicalizing South. A veteran of World War 1 and prior elected Governor in 1926, and nonConsecutively in 1934, Governor Graves has stood strong on his platform of helping the common man over the wealthy planters and industrialists of the state. While not in office in 1932 he was a leading unionist albeit his efforts to remain in the Union failed when Georgia seceded. While Alabama now remains an isolationist Republic many younger political factions remain in the shadows for the 1938 Governor election. In which Graves is unable to run."

     alabama.2.t:0 "Jeffersonian Democrat Party"
    alabama.2.d:0 "The Jeffersonian Democrat Party is a brainchild of the former US Senator James Thomas Heflin. Heflin has long been a political figure in Alabama politics and even national. However, due to his anti-Catholic and ultra segregationist speeches around the country even refusing to support Catholic Democratic Nominee Al Smith in 1926. Business leaders of the state rallied against him refusing him the democratic renomination in 1930. Heflin ran as a Jeffersonian Democrat. While he lost he managed to get 40% of the vote in the independent south. Since then he has spent his time damning the Republican Hoover, the Big Mules and blacks. However, many see him as a declining figure in the Jeffersonian Democrat Party, soon to be out shadowed by younger men."

    alabama.3.t:0 "Representative Connor denounces Graves"
    alabama.3.d:0 "Representative Eugene Bull Connor of Birmingham has denounced the Governor as weak on the labor issue. Connor has demanded full protections for all white labor organizations in the state from Northern strike breakers. He demanded Governor throw \"yankee\" strike breakers out of the state using the Army Like Talmadge in Georgia. This news comes to a shock to many in the Democrat Party as Connor stumped for the House in 1934 as a stern defender of the progressive Graves. Such news may split up harmony among Bibbs North Alabama faction already being nibbled on by Tom Cotton"

      alabama.4.t:0 "Letter from a Scotosbro Boy"
    alabama.4.d:0 "Young negro Eugene Williams has written us from prison asking that we consider pardoning him or at the very least commute his sentence. Eugene and the other eight Scotosbro Boys were sentenced to death in 1932 for accusations of raping two white women on a train depot. They were sentenced to hang in Decemember of 1938. The judge sentenced them later to hang than usual due to backlash from the Northern Press. The case is gaining more traction however outside of Alabama despite most coloreds here not seeming to care. Pardoning them could enrage the many in the South. Many Democrats fear that a pardon for the boys could swing a backlash to put the small but agressive Jeffersonian Democratic parties into power."
