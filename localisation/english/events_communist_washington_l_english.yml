We had to cut some corners overtime during our campaigns to unite the region and many reactionaries and revisionist lackeys have slipped through the cracks and many hold signifficant positions in our country. These people uphold the bourgeois ideals of, electoralism, upholding bourgeois and racist unions such as the AFL, White chauvinism, Trotskyism, state atheism, market 'Socialism' and other preposterous ideas that if implemented will lead to the downfall of our revolution in its infancy.This internal reactionary threat may pose the most signifficant challenge to us yet! To defend the masses from possible capitalist restoration and to uphold the People's Democratic Dictatorship which will lead to the liberation of all the American toilers we must keep the party pure, and to maintain a revolutionary and progressive society!"
