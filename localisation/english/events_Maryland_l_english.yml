      maryland.1.d:0 "Late last night Governor Albert Ritchie died of a brain hemorrhage. Ritchie was the longest serving Governor as he’d started off being elected Governor in 1920. His death has shocked many as he was not quite yet an old man. On top of this many fear riots as Ritchie faced a tough election in 1934 which left many screaming that he cheated. In this power vacuum Field Marshal Pedro del Valle has stepped in declaring marshal law. The Maryland Guard has rallied behind Valle and seem to be aping the military junta of those dirty New Jersians. As the state has no Lt Governor to succeed Ritchie many have already accepted the General fearing a civil war would lead to federal invasion. ."
