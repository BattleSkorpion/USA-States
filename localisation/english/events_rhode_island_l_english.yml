    rhode_island.1.d: "Election Seasons have never been this tense before, however nobody knew why. Perhaps it was the constant labor strikes, the weak authority of the Rhode Island government, or maybe it was the opposition to the democrats finally revealed. The Socialist Party of Rhode Island had gain alot of popularity during this year. As it turned out the leader of this party was none other than the author H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft held a speech to crowd of people proclaiming Rhode Island's government a failure for being far too weak to govern and that they step down in this election. After this speech it seems the Democrat's hold on Rhode Island is unable to hold."
