washington.1.t:0 "The Dire Situation At Hand"
washington.1.d:0 "Since the demise of the Union Washington State has been rocked by a wave of radicalism with its origins dating back decades. Since the turn of the century, Washington had been a hotspot for the ideas of the Socialist Party & Industrial Workers of the World, with both clashing against right wing forces in our state and staging the infamous 1919 Seattle General Strike which was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. Counter-Revolutionaries over time also stepped up to the plate such as the KKK, American Legion and most recently the Union Party. From 1934-1935 Our State was walloped by 2 massive strikes that hit our biggest industries: The 1934 West Coast Waterfront strike and the 1935 Pacific Northwest Timber Strike, both devastating our economy temporarily and causing dozens of deaths and casualties as the far left and far right duke it out in our streets while the National Guard continues rapid militarization and expansion to counter these extremes who are taking advantage of the lingering Great Depression still effecting our state due to the status quo's constant bickering and lack of action on solving the depression. The people of Washington are growing weary with the lack of change or improvement while extremists continue to fan the flames of division to prepare a power grab in this election year. Many fear our State will end up down the same route as Oregon if this is allowed to continue. If Washington is to keep the Democratic Capitalist torch burning throughout the Pacific Northwest, it must take drastic measures now."
washington.1.a:0 "A deeply concerning situation..."

washington.2.t:0 "1936 Snap Elections"
washington.2.d:0 "The election year of 1936 has proven to be the most bloody and chaotic in recent history, with our state narrowly avoiding a Communist uprising, it is time to return to our democratic ideals and settle on a suitable, hopefully non radical candidate..."
washington.2.a:0 "Martin narrowly wins! 4 More Years!"
washington.2.b:0 "The Republican Alternative Wins!"
washington.2.c:0 "A Surprise Progressive Victory!"
washington.2.d:0 "The National Guard cancels the election!"

washington.10.t:0 "Mayday Revolt!"
washington.10.d:0 "Following the Battle of Issaquah, the Reds gathered their forces in Seattle and declared the Second Seattle General Strike in order to paralyze our state's control over the city and seize power for themselves. Workers have been organized by the CPW and IWW in collaboration, and armories have been broken into as the police flee the overwhelming numbers of reds. As red banners fly over the Seattle area, chaos has engulfed our largest city and main industrial center. Washington's civil war has officially begun."
washington.10.a:0 "Rally the National Guard!"
washington.10.b:0 "§RHoist the Banner of Labor High!(Join Them)§R"

washington.4.t:0 "The Second Everett Massacre"
washington.4.d:0 "The day started off typically as the IWW and their supporters rallied in Everett for a monthly memorial march to the dockyards to commemorate the beginning of 1936, which marked the 20th anniversary of the first Everett Massacre. Nobody expected any commotion until a large police force arrived at the docks, backed up by local posse members. The IWW was blocked off from entering the Calista steamboat by the Police & their posse and then things turned violent, fast. A brawl ensued and then shots were fired in a close-range engagement that began inside the crowd which was bound to cause collateral damage. In total 14 men and women lay dead at the Everett docks again, this time 20 years later. It remains unclear which side started the brawl and who shot first but governor Martin and the media put the blame on the Reds."
washington.4.a:0 "When will people stop repeating history?!"

washington.5.t:0 "Lake Sammamish Massacre"
washington.5.d:0 "As tensions have continuously grown in our state the far left and far right have continued to clash. This time a massacre has occurred over a lakeside picnic! The CPW planned on having a women's day picnic at Lake Sammamish until their plans were abruptly ended during an encounter with the Silver Legion that spun out of control. Eyewitnesses claim the Legionnaires approached the picnic goers and their husbands and tried provoking them into fighting. Instead of a knuckle sandwich, they received a hail of bullets as everyone along the lake scrambled for cover. The pitched battle lasted for about 40 minutes until emergency services could arrive and broker a ceasefire to tend to the wounded as both sides scrambled away to avoid charges. In total 7 men on both sides and 2 women lay dead at the end of the massacre. Many see the increased political violence in our state as a sign of what's coming next..."
washington.5.a:0 "A damn shame."

washington.6.t:0 "The Battle of Issaquah!"
washington.6.d:0 "After months of mass casualty incidents and further radicalization on both sides of the political spectrum, the Communists have officially taken up arms after a bloody coal mine and timber strike in Issaquah. The Communists there have taken control of their workplaces, barricading themselves in fortified strong points being sustained by a large organized network of supporters of labor. The geographic position of the communists poses a significant challenge to state authorities, as the Issaquah Alps is quite a formidable position."
washington.6.a:0 "Send in the National Guard to crush the Communists held up there!"
washington.6.b:0 "§RThe Communists dig in and call upon Seattle sympathizers to take arms!§R"

washington.7.t:0 "Washingtonian Ultimatium!"
washington.7.d:0 "Washington State is demanding we submit our sovereignity to them and that we become apart of their state, should we accept this offer or should we fight like hell to send these invaders home?"
washington.7.a:0 "Rally the troops!"
washington.7.b:0 "We shall accept this offer"

washington.8.t:0 "Fate of the Paramilitaries."
washington.8.d:0 "The Provisonal Government needs to make a decision on the status of the remaining paramilitaries left over from the Union Party and the Silver Legion, what should their fate be?"
washington.8.a:0 "Conserve them and integrate them into the army."
washington.8.b:0 "Dissolve them for the sake of stability."

washington.9.t:0 "The Shasta Question"
washington.9.d:0 "Shasta, and subsequently the entirety of Northern California rightfully belongs to us, as it is geographically and culturally similar to the Pacific Northwest. We must lay claim to this region!"
washington.9.a:0 "It's time to take back what's ours!"

washington.11.t:0 "Crush The Socialists in Seattle!"
washington.11.d:0 "The Reds used their general strike to gain full control over the city and its surronding suburbs, as the rich flee to state controlled land out of fear of reprisals and wealth redistribution. We are forced to act with the upmost authority and harsh force on these Reds if we want to prevent Communist Totalitarianism from taking over our beloved state!"
washington.11.a:0 "Attack!"

washington.12.t:0 "The Washington Klan Welcomes Us!"
washington.12.d:0 "Our fellow Cyclops in Washington have welcomed us to their faction, dedicated to spreading the great ideals of the Klan to the North! Should we accept this invitation?"

washington.14.t:0 "§GEcological§b Collapse?"
washington.14.d:0 "After a few years of our ruthless subdument of nature and deforestation campaigns our home region in the Pacific Northwest was quite surprisingly been rocked by a wave of mudslides, floods and forest fires. Some locals speculate these horrible natural disasters have been happening more frequently due to the lack of trees and their roots that keep hills from shifting and rivers from flooding. Meanwhile the fire problem keeps cropping up in our most successful industrial facilities in the hinterlands. We aren't quite sure why this keeps happening but we must allocate some sort of funding to compensate our angered citizenry."
washington.14.a:0 "Why does this keep happening?!"
