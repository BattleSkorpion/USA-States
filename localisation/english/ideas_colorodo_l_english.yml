  SCO_miner_unrest_desc:0 "Colorado has a long history of unrest and outright war stemming from the state's miner population. Miners form the economic backbone of the State's economy and have been constantly gotten the short end of the stick when it came to their living conditions. Miner's strikes were almost always put down with armed force from the state government and Colorado practically was on the brink of civil war with the Coalfield wars back in the 1910's. Now a Coloradan Civil War may become a reality due to the Miners finally reaching their boiling point after the 1927 Columbine Massacre and other clashes with the government in recent years."
