north_carolina.1.d:0 "Hoey has recently formed the Southern Defense Council, and has given us a formal invite to join, shall we do it?"
north_carolina.1.a:0 "We used to be united, and we shall be once again!"
north_carolina.1.b:0 "Tell him no thanks"

north_carolina.2.t:0 "Carolinian Cooperation"
north_carolina.2.d:0 "Hoey has decided to form the Southern Defense Council, and the first and most obvious member of it would be our southern neighbor, South Carolina."
north_carolina.2.a:0 "An important first step"
north_carolina.2.b:0 "We'd rather go it alone"

north_carolina.3.t:0 "Virginian Cooperation"
north_carolina.3.d:0 "Hoey has recently formed the Southern Defense Council, and has given us a formal invite to join, shall we do it?"

north_carolina.4.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
north_carolina.4.d:0 "With another four years having passed since the last (and truly final) American election, the people of North Carolina have decided to continue the tradition of 4-year terms and are now looking to elect a new leader. The candidates are as follows; Clyde R. Hoey, a former North Carolina Representative who is running with the Democratic Party; William Dudley Pelley, an author from Massachusetts who resides in Asheville and is running with the self-proclaimed Silver Legion of America; and Paul Crouch, an activist and former soldier who is running with the Communist Party."
north_carolina.4.a:0 "Let's stay with the Democrats; elect Hoey!"
north_carolina.4.b:0 "Pelley seems eccentric... we like it!"

north_carolina.5.t:0 "Pelley wants to Join Us"
north_carolina.5.d:0 "The Fascist Dictator of North Carolina has called on us to allow him into our merry band of Populists. Pelley is known across the country for his anti-semitism and religious extremism. The man rose only recently, inspired by Mussolini and other European dictators. While him and his Silvershirts don't share all our values, they do hate communism. On top of that they are political outsiders who are rather disliked by the North-Eastern Elite. North Carolina is a powerhouse for sure, with them in the Jeffersonian League the South will be ours. But at what price?"
north_carolina.5.a:0 "The More the Better!"
north_carolina.5.b:0  "He's a nutjob, no way! "

north_carolina.6.t:0 "J. Melville Broughton Inauguration"
north_carolina.6.d:0 "After winning last year's general election, Governor Elect Broughton will take office today as North Carolina's 60th Governor. Broughton is a reformer, but is unlikely to drastically change the state one way or the other."
north_carolina.6.a:0 "Cool!"

north_carolina.7.t:0 "North Carolina wants to join the League"
north_carolina.7.d:0 "North Carolina recently has adopted the Share the Wealth program and has even given us credit for the idea. The nation now seeks membership in the Jeffersonian League. We have little reason not to let them in. At this point they may overshadow us within our own faction, but even then we hold the reigns over Oklahoma. Likely we can work together."
north_carolina.7.a:0 "The More the Merrier!"
north_carolina.7.b:0  "No way!"

north_carolina.50.t:0 "A Night of Terror"
north_carolina.50.d:0 "Late last night, screams of terror could be heard as thousands of Silver Shirts marched throughout the streets of Raleigh, attacking anyone who had connections to The Union of Comrades, a communist and fiercely anti-Pelley organization. While demonstrations throughout the city had been occurring regularly since Pelley's victory in the election, they had never been seen on this magnitude. Anyone who was outside at the time was a potential target, with demonstrators brutally beating, mugging, and in some cases executing suspected 'Hoeyists' as they called them. When news reached Pelley about the riots, he hesitated to call for action, only doing so after hearing an explosion not too far from where he was staying. After all was said and done, 13 were killed, with countless more injured and millions of dollars in damage."
north_carolina.50.a:0 "They had it coming!"

north_carolina.51.t:0 "Pelley's Speech"
north_carolina.51.d:0 "There is no time more important in our young nation's history than right now, for we have the chance to become something great, something that our ancestors would be proud of. We can achieve a level of glory that most can only ever dream of. To do it though, will require each and every one of you to put in your share of the work, for nothing short of your hardest will suffice. We must first focus on ourselves, purifying the state of any imperfections and imposing the teachings of Jesus Christ among all the people of our great nation! Once we are pure, we must work on creating a fighting force so strong that nobody would dare to oppose it! Finally, we will lead a brilliant and quick campaign against our enemies, restoring Southern glory! Only then shall we have achieved greatness!"
north_carolina.51.a:0 "Lets get to work!"

north_carolina.52.t:0 "Rooting Out Our Imperfections"
north_carolina.52.d:0 "The Jewish race and their Judeo-Bolshevik allies must pay! Our society's only imperfections are the vile outcasts of society that haven't been hunted down yet. It is time to call upon our entire White populace to rally and vanquish these last vestiges of the old decadent carpetbagger order!"
north_carolina.52.a:0 "Damn them!"

north_carolina.53.t:0 "North Carolina Approaches Us"
north_carolina.53.d:0 "The Longist aligned government of North Carolina approached our government today with diplomatic offers and invitations. We could join North Carolina's faction and keep a tight knit cultural bond between the two of our states for future cooperation. On the other hand, some in our government are skeptical about how sincere North Carolina is when it comes to maintaining our independence."

north_carolina.56.b:0 "A mighty fine idea, Carolina will be united UNDER North Carolina."

north_carolina.57.a:0 "A mighty fine idea."
