indiana.thd.1.t:0 "The Dragon's Drunken Realm"
indiana.thd.1.d:0 "    The Grand Dragon, commander of the new Klan, albeit this should’ve gone to the Imperial Wizard, of which there is none anymore. But after tireless campaigning in and across the state, Dwight successfully secured a victory against the wretched Jacksonian menace, and the Dragon is here to stay after all. With the status quo reassured, the rebirth of a nation may now be upon us.\n    Regardless of the Dragon’s victory, the state is still in crisis. The crisis is only partially from the troubles addressed back in the Indianapolis Meetings, because in fact, from the ashes of the Chicago Gang Wars back in 1929, Alphonse Capone’s criminal empire, often called the Portside Gang, is likely the greatest threat... or at least, it LED TO the greatest threat in the history of the Hoosierdom, to be specific. Control over the power of the other great two "Side" Gangs, Northside and Southside has since fallen to Capone's Crime Family, yet the Northside, however and surprisingly, survived just barely by crawling underground and scurrying back up into Gary where racketeers continue to make a ruckus. Dean O’Banion, even more shockingly, apparently survived his assassination at his flower shop, where many assumed him to be gunned down and dead, since. In a hard twist of events, he just so slightly escaped in a trail of bloody flowers.\n    Now, O’Banion returns to rebuild his own criminal empire to the skies, with alcohol as gold. This spiraled into a booming age for the Irish mobs, and created a now unmanageable battle with the Northside, rebranded as the Steel Syndicate, as their activities continue to fly under our sight, and the immense corruption they’ve created with the northern governments leaves us without a capable police force, who most have since turned on us in favor of their rum. Our army is shattered from the inside out whenever we attempt to reclaim our cities due to their unconventional tactics, which we are not  ready for, and our loyal Klansmen are being slaughtered for they are deemed the greatest hindrance to the gold, according to the Syndicate. \n    One way or another, the Syndicate will fall-"

### RACE WAR

indiana.race.1.t:0 "Governor Moves Against the Negros"
indiana.race.1.d:0 "The General Assembly passed multiple new "protection" laws in the effort to wipe the communist menace from the south of the state, which continues to creep north. The Grand Dragon, Dwight Stephenson, also issued a decree to mobilize the Klanist paramilitary, known as the "Knights", to act as a "clean-up force", as he puts it, in an attempt to restore "purity to the rabid-conquered". Of course, the negro population in Indiana is most certainly already responding with their own militias, but so far we’ve been able to reduce violence to minor store-to-store battles, but it’s unknown how much longer the "peace" can be maintained."
indiana.race.1.a:0 "Like 1933, it should blow over soon"

indiana.race.2.d:0 ""STUDENTS ROUT KLANSMEN", as the booming headline read on the day’s papers. Catholic students and negro students alike ran out to the streets during a misty day of Klan parades and patrols, hurling bricks from buildings and tackling and beating down Klansmen, before stealing their robes and parading with them. This group of students has since become known as the "Bed-Sheet Bandits", a name which has since stuck as new student, and generally anti-Klanist, groups surged in size since the previous major crackdown in 1934.\n    It was only a matter of time before the first shot rang, and the first casualty of the race war lay face-down in the red-painted street.\n\n    "STUDENT KILLED IN KLAN PATROL", as the next booming headlines came storming in. 17-year-old Johnathan Krump was shot dead after attempting to brawl with one of the armed guards defending the parade outside Notre Dame. The state, also since, has become increasingly more outraged with the violence against the "unarmed" kids, ignoring the bricks, that day... well, a minority, to say truthfuly. The majority are still too loyal to the Dragon’s hand, and seem more outraged by the fact that these kids even attacked their fellow subordinates to begin with. The streets of Notre Dame became a bloodbath since that day forward, as catholics and negros have taken up arms to contest the Klan’s control over the city, even calling in their "Bed-Sheet Bandits" yet again to tackle the Klan, but this time with the piercing steel bullet.\n\n    In response, Governor Dwight Stephenson, today, has enacted a second crack-down on the negro resistance which has now expanded as another catholic crackdown too, which continues to build up, now rampantly, in the south after the incident in Notre Dame, northward. The streets, now across the state, are already becoming a horror scene as the local Klan paramilitaries mobilize their rifles, boots, and tanks in an "-ocean of blood which bleeds from both sides--Like the Great War brought here to my city." as described by a surviving resident of the Evansville "Clean-Up" Operation. The catholic-negro organized resistance is erupting into a full-blown revolution akin to the Black Belt Revolts in Dixieland. Where does the state go from here? Likely, the catholic-negro revolution is wiped from the soil, BUT in that slim chance that all goes so, so wrong...
