indiana.thd.1.t:0 "The Dragon's Drunken Realm"
indiana.thd.1.d:0 "    The Grand Dragon, commander of the new Klan, albeit this should’ve gone to the Imperial Wizard, of which there is none anymore. But after tireless campaigning in and across the state, Dwight successfully secured a victory against the wretched Jacksonian menace, and the Dragon is here to stay after all. With the status quo reassured, the rebirth of a nation may now be upon us.\n    Regardless of the Dragon’s victory, the state is still in crisis. The crisis is only partially from the troubles addressed back in the Indianapolis Meetings, because in fact, from the ashes of the Chicago Gang Wars back in 1929, Alphonse Capone’s criminal empire, often called the Portside Gang, is likely the greatest threat... or at least, it LED TO the greatest threat in the history of the Hoosierdom, to be specific. Control over the power of the other great two "Side" Gangs, Northside and Southside has since fallen to Capone's Crime Family, yet the Northside, however and surprisingly, survived just barely by crawling underground and scurrying back up into Gary where racketeers continue to make a ruckus. Dean O’Banion, even more shockingly, apparently survived his assassination at his flower shop, where many assumed him to be gunned down and dead, since. In a hard twist of events, he just so slightly escaped in a trail of bloody flowers.\n    Now, O’Banion returns to rebuild his own criminal empire to the skies, with alcohol as gold. This spiraled into a booming age for the Irish mobs, and created a now unmanageable battle with the Northside, rebranded as the Steel Syndicate, as their activities continue to fly under our sight, and the immense corruption they’ve created with the northern governments leaves us without a capable police force, who most have since turned on us in favor of their rum. Our army is shattered from the inside out whenever we attempt to reclaim our cities due to their unconventional tactics, which we are not  ready for, and our loyal Klansmen are being slaughtered for they are deemed the greatest hindrance to the gold, according to the Syndicate. \n    One way or another, the Syndicate will fall-"

### DISSIDENTS

indiana.race.1.t:0 "Draining the Whirlpool"
indiana.race.1.d:0 "The General Assembly, today, just passed multiple new "protection laws" as part of the continued effort to drain the communist whirlpool from both the rural south and the industrial north of the state. Governor Edward Jackson has been advised to deploy the Community Protection, a paramilitary also known as the Knights, by the Interior Bureau, overseen by Dwight Stephenson, in what they will assure the public to be "the formation of another routine community clean-up committee". The treasonous population in Indiana organized by the FWLP, even if a small minority, is expected to respond with their own farmer and steel-worker fighters, although it's a likely possibility that most of the encounters with the FWLP will not escalate beyond tense stand-offs in barns and on the streets, but it definitely won't make the public feel any better for the time being."
indiana.race.1.a:0 "Well like 1934, it should blow over too."

indiana.race.2.d:0 ""STUDENTS ROUT KLANSMEN", as the booming headline read on the day’s papers. Catholic students of Notre Dame ran out to the streets during a misty day of Klan parades and patrols, hurling bricks from buildings and tackling and beating down Klansmen, before stealing their robes and parading with them. This group of students has since become known as the "Bed-Sheet Bandits", a name which has since stuck as new student, and generally anti-Klanist, groups surged in size since the previous major crackdown in 1934, which got leaked to the public, although only the small amount of dissidents really care enough.\n    It was only a matter of time before the first shot rang, and the first casualty of the Notre Dame brawl lay face-down in the red-painted street.\n\n    "STUDENT KILLED IN KLAN PATROL", as the next booming headlines came storming in. 17-year-old Johnathan Krump was shot dead after attempting to brawl with one of the armed guards defending the parade outside Notre Dame. The state, also since, has become increasingly more outraged with the violence against the "unarmed" kids, ignoring the bricks, that day... well, a minority, to say truthfuly. The majority are still too loyal to the Dragon’s hand, and seem more outraged by the fact that these kids even attacked their fellow subordinates to begin with, although they still send their condolences. The streets of Notre Dame has become a frightening fog since that day forward, as the catholics' clique continue to take up arms to contest the Klan’s control over the city in desperate attempt to overthrow the Klan's government in Notre Dame, and even South Bend as a whole, even calling in their "Bed-Sheet Bandits" yet again to tackle the Klan, but this time awaiting the moment to come in pouncing by with the piercing steel bullet.\n\n    It's insanely crucial that any more conflict be resolved before bullets go flying, and bodies start piling. Already, the Klan's reputation is beginning to feel the first blunt of the burn for the controversy around the Notre Dame brawl, so in response, Governor Dwight Stephenson, today has decided to..."
