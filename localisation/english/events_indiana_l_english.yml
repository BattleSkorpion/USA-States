indiana.thd.1.d:0 "The Grand Dragon, commander of the new Klan, albeit this should’ve gone to the Imperial Wizard, of which there is none anymore. But after tireless campaigning in and across the state, Dwight managed to secure a victory against the wretched Jacksonian menace, and the Dragon is here to stay after all. With the status quo reassured, the rebirth of a nation may now be upon us./n Regardless of the Dragon’s victory, the state is still in crisis, partially from the troubles addressed back in the Indianapolis Meetings but, from the ashes of the Chicago Gang Wars back in 1929, Alphonse Capone’s criminal empire, often called the Portside Gang, seized control over the other great two "Side" Gangs, Northside and Southside. The Northside, however, survived just barely, crawling underground and scurrying back up into Gary, where racketeers make a ruckus. Dean O’Banion apparently survived his assassination, where many assumed him to be dead since that incident, however he escaped just so slightly in a trail of bloody flowers./n Now, O’Banion returns to rebuild his own criminal empire, with alcohol as gold. This created a soon unmanageable battle with the Northside, rebranded as the Steel Syndicate, as their activities continue to fly under our sight and the immense corruption they’ve created with the northern governments leaves us without a capable police force, who most have since turned on us in favor of their rum. Our army is shattered from the inside out whenever we attempt to reclaim our cities, and our loyal Klansmen are being slaughtered for they are deemed the greatest hindrance, according to the Syndicate. /n One way or another, the Syndicate will fall-"
