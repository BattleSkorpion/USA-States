  virginia.2.t:0 "The Tidewater War"
  virginia.2.d:0 "This war against the Negroes of Tidewater will be an easy one, they fight cowardly and refuse to engage us in the open field, until now. Our superior Anglo-Saxon race will triumph over them!"

  virginia.3.t:0 "Lee's Coup"
  virginia.3.d:0 "Lee has successfully gained a populist appeal with the penny drive and constant radio broadcasts but he has also simultaneously promised to the old agricultural families they will keep their privileges if he gains power. The Army has remained somewhat neutral, however, with many officers being turned off by his populist appeal but still contempt with his support for a much larger military budget and investments to improve the Army. Thankfully due to these promises last night Lee and a special cadre of old respectable officers marched into the state capitol, armed to the teeth with shotguns and rifles they declared the end of the Virginian Republic and announced that King Lee will be coronated as king tomorrow morning! Soon after the nighttime radio address pro Monarchist paramilitary forces stormed into the houses of Republican and Democrat officials and placed them under house arrest. George Peery was escorted out of his house by these paramilitaries and forced to announce his resignation on the morning of Lee's triumphant coronation. But everything wasn't perfect. Massive riots broke out in black areas of our state and many cities were consumed with violence between pro-Republican protestors versus the local police and army garrisons. Even amongst our army a brigade deserted and attempted to conduct a counter-coup at Arlington, but this traitorous ploy was quickly dispatched thanks to our cavalry's superior firepower. Three Cheers for Lee!" 
  virginia.3.a:0 "Hail to the King!"
  
  
  virginia.4.t:0 "Secret Meetings"
  virginia.4.d:0 "Van Horn Mosley has been meeting with many high ranking officers in our military. We've only recently been tipped off about these meetings by an officer that is either loyal or dissatisfied with Mosely. We are not yet sure how long these meetings have been going on for or what is being planned in them, but surely they cannot be good for the state. Now that we know about them, many of our advisors recommend we put a stop to these meetings."
  virginia.4.a:0 "It's time for a coup"  

  virginia.5.t:0 "Bloody Night"
  virginia.5.d:0 "The night of Moseley's coup would colloquially be called the 'Bloody Night'. Moseley's armed coup plotters stormed the state capitol in the afternoon, facing no real resistance as the governor was placed under arrest and a official military decree would exclaim that the current state government will be abolished and Virginia will return to her past glory and Moseley is now the commander in chief of the entire state! As nightfall fell on our state Moseley's men began rounding up political opponents, and taking them to behind the shed executions, Republican carpetbaggers, liberal industrialists, Jews, Blacks, and anybody else who opposed Moseley's form of Fascism became a direct target in this bloody night. Over 500 people were summarily executed and more than a thousand were arrested in the following days. Moseley has almost fully cemented his power over Virginia, it is only a matter of time until he takes complete power."

  virginia.7.b:0 "We don't need them!"
  
  
  virginia.25.t:0 "West Virginia Questiom"
  virginia.25.d:0 "Before the War of Southern Indepedence West Virginia used to be part of our Dominion. However, during the War the land was quickly occupided by federals who then created a state from Unionist traitors to form the what today is West Virginia. While Virginians have seen this loss as the price of defeat many now wonder if we should retake our former terrority. Afterall, West Virginia is very poor and weak. Byrdism is based on rural control so perhaps we can use a takeover of them to increase our power base. On the otherhand Virginians don't truely desire a war. What shall our Governor do?"
  virginia.25.a:0 "Country Roads is best Left Alone!"
  virginia.25.b:0 "West Virginians must Atone!"
