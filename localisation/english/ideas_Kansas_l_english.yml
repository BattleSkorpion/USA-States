  SKS_KKK_Collapse_desc:0 "The KKK has had a tough time keeping a presence in Kansas for many years, with Kansans having strong principles on equal treatment and with much of their history forged from it since its time as a young territory. Kansas during the mid 20s dealt the Kansas Chapter a number of successive losses legally in the state leading to the full collapse and outlawing of KKK presence in Kansas. It stands as a firm reminder of Kansas's commitment against racial and religious intimidation and terror."
