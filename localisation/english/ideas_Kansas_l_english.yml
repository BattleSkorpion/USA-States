  SKS_KKK_Collapse:0 "Klan Ousted"
  SKS_KKK_Collapse_desc:0 "The Klan has had a tough time keeping a presence in Kansas for many years, with Kansans having strong principles on equal treatment and with much of their history forged from it since its time as a young territory. Kansas during the mid 20s dealt the Atchison Chapter a number of successive losses legally in the state leading to the full collapse and outlawing of Klan presence in Kansas. It stands as a firm reminder of Kansas's commitment against racial and religious intimidation and terror."
