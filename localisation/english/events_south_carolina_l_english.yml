    south_carolina.1.d:0 "The 1938 South Carolinian elections have shown to be the most divisive in recent memory. The right at the ballot box is represented by Coleman Blease, a staunch white supremacist firebrand. The center is represented by reform minded former Senator James Brynes. On the other end is the expansionist minded Wyndham Manning."

    south_carolina.2.t:0 "George Stinney"
    south_carolina.2.d:0 "George Stinney is a 14 year old African-American boy from the small mill town of Alcolu. He is suspected of murdering two White children, there has been no evidence of him being the perpetrator of this brutal crime but the town of Alcolu and the Whites of the region are hellbent on the death penalty for the child. If executed George, would be the youngest person in American history to be executed"
    south_carolina.2.a:0 "Execution by Electric Chair is the only option."
      
    south_carolina.3.t:0 "1942 Election"
    south_carolina.3.d:0 "The time has come for people to select their next Governor. People can choose from Maybanks, Brynes' protege, or former Governor Johnston. However, the Redshirt Movement has also picked up steam being led by young lawyer Strom Thurmond who's running as a Democrat."
    south_carolina.3.a:0 "Maybanks is our Guy."
    south_carolina.3.b:0 "Johnston did a Good Job Last time."
    south_carolina.3.c:0 "Thurmond!"
    
    south_carolina.4.t:0 "South Carolina Challenges us to Football Game"
    south_carolina.4.d:0 "Governor Johnston of South Carolina has challenged us to a football game between our two countries to take place in Augusta with money going to local orphanages. We of course have no choice bu to accept. Doing anything else would make us look like a bunch of sissy boys. We can't have that."
    south_carolina.4.a:0 "Get us the Pig Skin."
     
    south_carolina.5.t:0 "Blease wants Guarantee"
    south_carolina.5.d:0 "South Carolina Governor Blease wants us to guarantee his country's independence. He believes North Carolina wants to undermine his nation's sovereignty. If he is correct that would put North Carolina's boarders on our doorstep, which isn't a good thing. On the other hand we could risk a serious war as our northern border could offer a easy path for the Tar-Heels to impale Atlanta."
    south_carolina.5.a:0 "We will cover their ass."
    south_carolina.5.b:0 "You're on your own Blease."
     
     
    south_carolina.6.t:0 "South Carolina Wants into our Faction"
    south_carolina.6.d:0 "Blease has made a great deal of pandering to Talmadge in order to get a meeting to join the Southern Committee. Together Blease believes a new Confederacy could be formed. This would allow South Carolina and Georgia to guide the future path of Dixie!"
    south_carolina.6.a:0 "Lets do it."
    south_carolina.6.b:0 "No Way."
     
    south_carolina.7.t:0 "Brynes Given More Powers"
    south_carolina.7.d:0 "For years the Governor of South Carolina has mostly been a ceremonial position with little actual power. Now, as it's essentially the highest office of the land, the General Assembly has relented to giving the Governor more power and let go of some of the various rules to weaken the Governorship's powers."
    south_carolina.7.a:0 "About Time."
     
     
    south_carolina.8.t:0 "South Carolina Wants to Join our Faction"
    south_carolina.8.d:0 "Reformer Governor Brynes wants to join the Southern Defense Council. He believes the Carolinas should work together economically and military to create prosperity for both our republics. He has made it clear his offer shouldn't be denied, as it will offend his peoples pride."
    south_carolina.8.a:0 "Let them in."
    south_carolina.8.b:0 "We don't need those aristocrats."


    south_carolina.9.t:0 "Bleaseism"
    south_carolina.9.d:0 "Coleman Blease is a former Governor and US Senator of South Carolina. Blease was first elected Governor of South Carolina in 1910 as a defender of White upcountry mill workers. He would become a chaotic force in state politics, liberally using his power of pardons, ignoring prohibition and encouraging lynchings. He would win re-election in 1912 but would fail in his efforts to run for the Senate. Throughout the 20s he'd continue trying and failing to run for statewide offices. He would win a brutal race for the Senate seat in 1924 against Brynes, which would launch him into being a national advocate for White Supremacy. He'd lose his seat in 1930 only to run for Governor in 1934 and lose to Johnston. In short, while it seems like Bleaseism is on the decline he has been known to make powerful political comebacks after long streaks of defeat. After all, he managed to win 43% of the vote for Governor in '34. Thus, he remains a powerful force in state politics despite his many foes. If given the political opportunity, he is likely to make his comeback. "
    south_carolina.9.a:0 "Will he return?"

    south_carolina.10.t:0 "Blease in Georgia" 
    south_carolina.10.d:0 "Former Governor Blease was reported to be in Augusta, Georgia today endorsing Eugene Talmadge for Governor. During a stump speech he denounced the current Governor Ed Rivers as a 'tool of Savannah Catholics' and said that if he was not defeated, Catholic Aristocrats on the coast in Savannah could build a new 'dominion of Popery' in Georgia. Notably in his speech Blease failed to mention incumbent Governor Johnston, whom he's feuded with since his last defeat for the Governorship in '34. Advisors of the Governor wonder if this perhaps shows he may be focusing on the next election for Governor, which Johnston won't be legally allowed to run in."
    south_carolina.10.a:0 "Perhaps he will leave us alone?"

    south_carolina.11.t:0 "Mayor Maybanks Announces Run for Governor" 
    south_carolina.11.d:0 "Today in Charleston, their youthful Mayor Burnet Rhett Maybank has declared his candidacy for Governor next year. He has aims at passing measures to get the state out of the current economic slump. He has used his long tenure as Mayor of Charleston as an example of how he plans to fix the state. He has argued that he will work with the state legislature to build public works projects and help the people of the state. He argued only compromise and building a beautiful state is what will get South Carolina out of the Depression. Former US Senator and fellow Charlestonian, James F Brynes, is known to be backing the charismatic Maybanks. With his popular status he will be able to likely unify the low country behind the shining young politician."

    south_carolina.12.t:0 "Manning wins Ajustant General Primary"
    south_carolina.12.d:0 "General Wyndham Manning has won the Democrat primary's nominee for Ajustant General. This is to no ones suprise as the popular General had the backing of many of the states progressives leaders. The General has promised to defend the constistition and rights of the South Carolinans as well as readying the small military to defend the Palmetoo Republic.

    south_carolina.13.d:0 "Sectrary of State 'Jimmmy' Brynes has announced his canidacy for Governor today in a massive rally in Charleston to a crowd of two thousand Democrats. The popular Sectary of State has promised to work for the betterment of all South Carolians both 'rich and poor'. He promises to oppose radicalism and bigotry in being Governor as well as expanding the states navy and armed forces. He also has taken a small shot at Governor Johnston by stating he'd work with the General Assembly rather than against them. Brynes has remained steadfast in his idea of a strong Governor working with the state leaders to get compromise reforms passed and passed quickly." 
    south_carolina.13.a:0 "Will he win?" 

    south_carolina.14.t:0 "Cotton Ed Condemns Welfare Program"
    south_carolina.14.d:0 "Agriculture Commissioner 'Cotton Ed' Smith has given a firey speech over the radio waves today comdemning the welfare program passed recently. He has claimed it will only encourage 'loaferism' and 'bums' to keep laying out of work. He also slammed the idea that negroes could also recieve welfare stating that they shouldn't be able to apply for any state sponsored welfare program. He has gone as far to claim he may block all state farm aide to negro farmers of 'bad character'."
    south_carolina.14.a:0 "Cotton Ed is up to his Old Shenigans!"

    south_carolina.16.t:0 "South Carolina invites us to their Dixie Coast Alliance"
    south_carolina.16.d:0 "South Carolina and it's President 'Jimmy Brynes' offer us membership in it's new alliance. Brynes seeks free trade into the Caribbean and into the Atlantic. He believes our powerful navy would be key to that. He also believes our relatively progressive domestic agenda is in lockstep with his own thus we make natural allies. He has brought up memories of us being the 3rd state to secede in 1861 thus Florida and South Carolina have always been friends. In accepting South Carolina as ally we would open up a powerful and much needed detterent to both Alabama and Georgia invading our flat borderlands. "
    south_carolina.16.a:0 "Together we shall rule the seas"
    south_carolina.16.b:0 "We don't need them."
       
    south_carolina.20.t:0 "South Carolina Offers Dominionship"
    south_carolina.20.d:0 "South Carolina has come to us with an offer of dominionship. In short their new Governor James Brynes has offered us protection and shared economic progress if we allow them to become our 'mother country'. While this may seem out of nowhere South Carolina and Barbados share a strong colonial connection. In the 1600s many of the South Carolina founders were sons of the Barbados English planter elite. Thus, many South Carolinians can trace their ancestors to Barbados.  The states ambassadors claim that if we allow them control they will not intrude on our internal matters. Many of our people are skeptical of this but on the other hand, should anyone attack our small Island we have little chance of victory. Thus, perhaps a protector is needed. "
    south_carolina.20.a:0 "We accept the offer!"
    south_carolina.20.b:0 "We shall never give up our freedoms to our former slavers!"
