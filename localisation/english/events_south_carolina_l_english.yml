    south_carolina.9.t:0 "Bleaseism"
    south_carolina.9.d:0 "Coleman Blease is a former Governor and US Senator of South Carolina. Blease was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1910 as a defender of White upcountry mill workers. He would be a choatic force in state politics using his power of pardons, ignoring prohibition and encouraging lynchings. He would win re-election in 1912 but would loose in his efforts to become Senate. The next decade he'd continue trying to run for statewide offices and failing. He would win a brutal race for the Senatorship in 1924 against Brynes which would launch him into being a national advocate for White Sumpremacy. He'd loose his seat in 1930 only to run for Governor in 1934 and loose to Johnston. In short while it seems like Bleaseism is on the decline he has been known to make powerful political comebacks after long streaks of defeats. Afterall he managed to win 43% of the vote for Governor in 34'. Thus, he remains a powerful force in state politics despite his many foes. If given the political opportunity issue he is likely to make his comeback. "

    south_carolina.10.t:0 "Blease in Georgia" 
    south_carolina.10.d:0 "Former Governor Blease was reported in Augusta Georgia today endorsing Eugene Talmadge for Governor. During a stump speech he damned the current Governor Ed Rivers as of 'Savannah Catholics' and said that if he was not defeated Catholic Aristocrats on the Coast in Savannah and Georgia could build a new 'dominion of Popery'. Notably in his speech Blease failed to mention incumbent Governor Johnston whom he's fueded for the last two years since his last defeat for the Governorship. Advisors of the Governor wonder if this perhaps shows he may be focusing on the next election for Governor which Johnston wouldn't be legally allowed to run in."
    south_carolina.10.a:0 "Perhaps he will leave us alone?"

    south_carolina.11.t:0 "Mayor Maybanks Announces Run for Governor" 
    south_carolina.11.d:0 "Today in Charleston their youthful Mayor Burnet Rhett Maybank has declared his candicy for Governor next year. He has declared the current Governor Johnston as 'ineffective' in passing 'progressive' measures to get the state out of the current economic slum. He has used his tenure as Mayor of the Charleston as a example of how he plans to fix the state. He has argued that he will work with the state legislature to build public work projects and help the people of the state. He argued only compromise and building a beautiful state is what will get South Carolina out of the Depression. Former US Senator and fellow Charlestonian, James F Brynes is known to be backing the charasamatic Maybanks. With his power as Sectary of State he will be able to likely unify the low country behind the shining young politican."
    south_carolina.11.a:0 "How dare he attack the Governor?"
