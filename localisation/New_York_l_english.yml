As the United States of America continued to fracture and plunge deeper into chaos, New York remained a strong ally to the Government in D.C.. That is, until Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York City, found it best for the city if it was independent from the Union. Fiorello made many formal requests to FDR for the whole state of New York to finally secede from the Union, but FDR refused. Nearing the end of 1932, Fiorello threatened to secede from not only the Union but also the state of New York if things did not change. With the threat of loosing the largest and most important city of New York, the New York State Assembly and Senate pushed to remove FDR from office. In the process of impeachment, many local militias of New York State - funded by New York City - revolted against the United State's Government. This revolt would result in New York becoming the second to last state to secede from the union in December 1932. Now an independent republic, New York State officialized the impeachment of FDR and FDR subsequently fled to the District of Columbia. The New York State Assembly and Senate formed the Congress of this new nation. The next Congress would come to be more loyal to the ideals of FDR, but nothing could be done because he was impeached. Around half of Congress and many of the people of New York remember FDR fondly, the strong memory of FDR will persist in New York until another leader can come to power to satisfy the needs of the people."

    SNY_independent_new_york_city_desc:0 "The impeachment of Franklin D. Roosevelt was driven in large part because of the threat that New York City would secede from New York State if the State would not secede from the failing Union. Despite the impeachment eventually passing, the damage was already done. New York City no longer trusted that its best interests were being looked out for by the State. In a compromise, New York City became a highly autonomous region of New York State, with its own politics and many of the powers of an independent country."

They say that if things do not change soon, the country will reach a breaking point and they do not want to be the ones dealing with such a mistake.

Echoing many of the same points of the army, The Navy has stated that if things do not get better soon, they will shift their allegiance to other countries as they see fit. The Navy has told Lehman to either fix the country or they will abandon us."

    new_york.3.d:0 "With the situation in the country still not improving, the army has shown that they were not joking around when they said that the country must be fixed. Every guard, soldier, and other armed personnel have been moved away from the capital in protest. The leading generals have told us that if the country becomes stable once again, they will return to guarding the capital building, but for now they stated they are done attacking peaceful protesters."

    new_york.4.d:0 "Herbert H. Lehman, the president of New York State, made a speech this morning criticizing the actions of The Army. \"While The Army may have criticized me and my administration, I have never performed an action so foolish as to abandon the capital building in a time of great need and instability for this great country we all call home. It is clear to me that their action was uninformed and I hope they see the error in this act and decide to return to defend the capital building in Albany.\" Lehman's speech did little to change the mind or hearts of The Army and the people who support their actions."

    new_york.5.t:0 "The Albany Attack"
    new_york.5.d:0 "Early this morning, the usual protest gathered in front of the capital building in Albany. Without the army there to threaten the protesters, the size of the protest was the largest since the breakup of the Union. On the streets, the protesters called for true democracy in the republic, for Franklin D. Roosevelt to return, for the end of the slaughter of innocent protesters by the hands of the police and - until recently - the army, and or change. \"We demand Life! We demand Liberty! We demand the Right to Pursue Happiness!\" Their cries could be heard for blocks and blocks surrounding the capital building in Albany. Herbert H. Lehman attempted to address the crowd like he always does. \"I have been trying my hardest to bring Life, Liberty, and Happiness to the people of New York. But it is Congress, not I, that continually wishes to stifle our Democracy and keep our country in a situation of prolonged political deadlock!\" Lehman's speech was cut short by the sound of gunfire radiating from the crowd. Immediately, Lehman retreated into the capital building for his own safety. Soon after, a poorly known, radical left congressman walked out from the crowd and gave his speech, his firearm concealed by his suit. \"Brothers in arms, we have gathered here today not because we are satisfied and to tell Lehman he's done a good job, we have gathered here today because was are DISSATISFIED and because Lehman has NOT done a good job.\" He paused for a brief applause from the crowd. \"Today is the day we must show Lehman just how unsatisfied we are with his administration!\" More applause. \"Now follow me fellow citizens of New York, follow me in my, in our, attack on the very administration that has made our lives hell! WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES NOON, WE ATTACK!\" More applause erupted from the crowd, many of them now blinded by the words of the congressman many of them didn't even know was a congressman. When the hour was noon, what would become known as \"The Albany Attack\" commenced. While initially lead by the congressman from before, he eventually retreated because he knew violence would ensue. In the end over two dozen protesters and guards were killed in the attack before the rest of the crowd was discouraged and gave up. While the number of people killed may have not been as much as in other tragic event in the past, it was enough to demonstrate the political instability in New York, the political violence. This attack will surely change the course of the country forever and will be remembered for many generations to come."

This is not a mistake I can fix from the background! In order to undo this damage and restore faith in not only our democracy, but in the Republic of New York as a whole, I have to take drastic measures.

Mulcahy, George Decker, and Bruce C. Clarke confronted Herbert H. Lehman inside the capital building with the security of a part of the nation's army just outside. Their request was simple. Step down as president of New York and as the Commander in Chief, and The Army would take over control. While Herbert H. Lehman did not want to agree to these terms, the military force just outside the building persuaded him otherwise. Lehman signed over New York to The Army. Lehman was then promptly kicked out of the capital building and The Army moved to make their rule over New York official."

Mulcahy, a naval aviator with some experience with the land, sea, and the air. The second candidate is Bruce C. Clarke, a leader who mostly has experience with land forces and has extensive experience with support engineers. The third candidate is George Decker, a leader who shows a lot of promise and has been rising quickly in the ranks of the military, he is an infantry leader at heart and completely despises the Navy"
