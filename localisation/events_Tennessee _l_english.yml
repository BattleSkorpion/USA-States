tennessee.9.d:0 "Alvin York, a Democrat from Eastern Tennessee and general in nation's army, has announced that he will be running in the 1940 Democratic Primary as a 'corruption free' candidate. General York believes in a strong military, with his service dating back the Great War, in which he was one of the most decorated soldiers of the war. General York is strongly anti-Jeffersonian and does believe in the ideals of fascists or populists. One more important thing of note about York is that he was a unionist in 32', and strongly believes in the principles of Washington."

tennessee.10.t:0 "Donald Davidson Declares His Candidacy In The 1940 Election"
tennessee.10.d:0 "Donald Davidson has announced his intent to run as a Democrat in the Tennessee Primaries. Davidson, who currently occupies a prestigious position at Vanderbilt University, is running on the idea of "returning Tennessee to agrarian society." Davidson believes that Tennessee should not attempt to compete with the industrial powers to the North, and rather return to Tennessee's roots as a state based purely on agriculture. In his speeches, Davidson is often quoted saying "Industrial society and its consequences will be a disaster for the human race." Maintaining segregation is also important to Davidson, with him believing that nearly 1/6 of the population is not "entitled to equality," and that race mixing prevents generational prosperity."
