tennessee.9.t:0 "Alvin York's Candidacy"
tennessee.9.d:0 "Alvin York, a Democrat from Eastern Tennessee and general in nation's army, has announced that he will be running in the 1940 Democratic Primary as a 'corruption free' candidate. General York believes in a strong military, with his service dating back the Great War, in which he was one of the most decorated soldiers of the war. General York is strongly anti-Jeffersonian and does believe in the ideals of fascists or populists. One more important thing of note about York is that he was a unionist in 32', and strongly believes in the principles of Washington."
tennessee.9.a:0 "An interesting candidate to say the least..."
