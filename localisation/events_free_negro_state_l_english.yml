While young Anglo Herdon has served as Provisonal President for our struggle for Indepedence against Alabmama, many question his leadership. Among those is Ned Cobb, a gurilla fighter who bombed and stole numerous equipment from the Alabama Republic. Cobb dreams of uniting the Deep South fully under Negroes and breaking up the plantations. Herndon belives we should take time to industrilize and work with liberals and socialists in the North."
