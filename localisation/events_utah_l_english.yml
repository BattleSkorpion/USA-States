utah.1.t:0 "The Pocatello Proclaimation"
utah.1.d:0 "Our victorious militias and regular infantrymen have liberated the Latter Day Saint City of Pocatello. Our leader has given a fiery speech delivering the now iconic proclaimation of Pocatello. The city of Pocatello symbolized our victory due to superior will and theology. These two factors led to the glorious victory we achieved today. From Pocatello we can rightfully claim Mormon lands along the West Coast and we have revived the dream of a Mormon Hawai'i in the future, we may not pursue these ambitious goals immediately but... God is smiling upon our chosen people and is cheering at the thousands of roused masses and soldiers who cheered on this pivotal proclaimation."
utah.1.a:0 "Onwards Brothers!"
