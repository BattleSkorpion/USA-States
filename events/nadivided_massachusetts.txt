	# EVENT FOR FALL RIVER OCTOBER 1941 RUBBER FIRE
	# The once mighty American Printing Company finally 
	# closed for good in 1934. In 1937, their huge plant 
	# waterfront on Water Street was acquired by the Firestone 
	# Tire & Rubber Company and soon employed 2,600 people. 
	# In October 1941, just a few weeks before the attack on 
	# Pearl Harbor, a huge fire broke out in the old 1860s' 
	# main building of the print works. The fire was a major 
	# setback to the U.S. war effort, as $15 million in raw rubber 
	# (30,000 lbs.) was lost in the inferno.
