# North America Divided

NOTE: We recommend contacting us before using anything native to our mod (such as the map). We gladly allow use of the map and etc. though we may want to mention some warnings or advice. 

 If youre going to be using development / github branches of the mod, 
 Github Desktop (https://desktop.github.com) is highly reccommended, 
 although not essential. Github Desktop provides an easy way to sync changes. 
 
 ## With Github Desktop
	Using Github Desktop, once you have set up the application and have an account, 
	Click File â†’ Clone Repository in the dialog box, under URL insert
   `https://github.com/BattleSkorpion/nadivided-dev`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod` under your user's Documents
   folder! Then click "Clone," of course. 
   Next, Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `nadivided-dev.mod`
   into the `mod` folder. Start up HOI4,
   and select our mod (local version). 
   
   ***Select the branch you want to use in Github before launching the game.*** 
   ***If unsure ask someone dear to your heart who is knowledgeable***
   
# Enjoy :)
