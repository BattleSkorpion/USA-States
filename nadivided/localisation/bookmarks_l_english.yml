 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."

 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 SID_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the breakup of the United States Idaho has been in a precarious position. At first leaving the union as beneficial, as many farmers felt the relief of no longer having to deal with Federal Taxes, however soon Idaho's dependency on the Union began to show. The symptoms started out small, higher food prices and a higher cost of labor. Then the economy started the swell. Without the ability to import many necessary goods from the rest of the United States and with less and cordial relations with many of its neighbors, Idaho could no longer support itself with its state reserve and soon a crisis emerged. The Potato Crisis, as it has come to be known, is the culmination of the reliance on one food crop and the high prices of all other goods and services. Will Idaho be able to get back onto their feet or will they continue to rot just like the potatoes they plant in their now overused soil? Only time will tell..."
 PON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the English successor of Canada a lot of weight has been put on Ontario's shoulders since the breakup of Canada. Unlike Quebec, the French successor for Canada, Ontario holds the old Canadian government in power, this has created much distrust in the population towards the government. While Ontario would normally be in an ideal situation to retake Canada, there are many internal problems which hold the country back. One such problem is dealing with the old Canadian Navy and Army, if they are not dealt with in some way the population's distrust in the government will only grow. Another is the problem of the industry, without the resources of the far north and west the Ontario economy is stagnating, but can easily be rejuvenated with the right policies and political actions. Will Ontario be able to regain trust in their population and reunite Canada, or will Ontario continue to stagnate as merely just another country on the North American continent?"
