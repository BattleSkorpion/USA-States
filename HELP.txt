#   Hello,
#   this hotfix is suppose to change nothing but get rid of any files that the mod does not use so the folder can be less chaotic and folder size shrunk.
#   
#   Problem is:
#   
#   I don't know how to update the mod on the workshop 
#   
#   &
#   
#   I don't know what files the mod uses and doesn't use other than the obvious
#   
#   (what I have removed so far is)
#   {
#       .\HELP.txt
#       .\.git
#   }
#   
#   (what I don't know, but am sus about if it is necessary or not)
#   {
#       .\leaders\Longfellow.png
#   }
#   
#   If you have read this file,
#   
#   Thank you, I appreciate it.
#   
#   I highly doubt anyone will unless I make them.
