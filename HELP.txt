Hello,
this hotfix is suppose to change nothing but get rid of any files that the mod does not use so the folder can be less chaotic and folder size shrunk.

Problem is:

I don't know how to update the mod on the workshop 

&

I don't know what files the mod uses and doesn't use other than the obvious

(what I have removed so far is)
{
    .\.gitignore
    .\unused\
    .\unused\nadivided [HD] [no title].png
    .\unused\nadivided [HD].png
    .\unused\nadivided [no title].png
    .\unused\nadivided [old].png
    .\README.md
    .\readme.log

    (will remove before hotfix release)
    .\HELP.txt
    .\.git
}

(what I don't know, but am sus about if it is necessary or not)
{
    .\CustomGFXResources\*
    .\events\oldbeehive\*
    .\events\oldny\*
    .\events\temporary Storage for old oregon civil war\*
    .\gfx\Orignal Picture png's
    .\gfx\gfx - shortcut.lnk
    .\leaders\Longfellow.png
    .\localisation\spanish\*
    .\hoi4 localizer 2.0.bat
    .\hoi4 localizer 2.0.txt
    .\hoi4 localizer.jar
    .\hoi4localizer\*
    .\LICENSE
}

If you have read this file,

Thank you, I appreciate it.

I highly doubt anyone will unless I make them.
